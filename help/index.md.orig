## Overview

Zebra Technologies provides devices for the enterprise to acquire, process and consume data from barcodes, mag-stripe and smart cards, RFID tags, images, text or other technologies. To enable Zebra partners and customers of varying skills and requirements to make use of its devices, we offer a broad array of tools designed to suit the requirements and capabilities of most any organization.

## Scanning
Zebra mobile and touch computers are equipped with a variety of scanning devices, each of which can be accessed through software included with the device or with apps developed by a partner or customer. Zebra's solutions are described below in order from easiest (and with the least coding required) to the most powerful and complex.  

### DataWedge - Add scanning to existing app
#### Easiest: minimal setup, coding optional

[DataWedge](../datawedge) provides barcode scanning and processing services for devices running Android, and is the fastest and easiest way to add scanning to an existing app. Included with every Zebra device, DataWedge enables any app on the device to acquire scanned data without using the scanner APIs directly. DataWedge can be configured in minutes to automatically activate a particular scanner or reader whenever a particular app is launched, and can manipulate and hand off acquired data according to simple or complex rules. 

**PROS**: **No coding required**, APIs increase power and versatility

**CONS**: Fixed feature set

-----

### SimulScan
#### Easy: moderate setup time, coding optional 

[SimulScan](../simulscan) is included only with [supported devices](../simulscan/1-1/guide/about/#supporteddevices), and is designed to optimize workflow by enabling acquisition of multiple points of data in a single step. SimulScan is well suited to organizations in which scanning is frequent, and scanned forms have one or more barcodes, or if multiple data types (such as barcodes, text and images) are to be acquired. Optionally, SimulScan can integrate with an organization's native Android app and parse captured data directly into the app. 

**PROS**: **No coding required**, APIs increase efficiency, effectiveness

**CONS**: Limited device support; longer setup time than DataWedge; subject to per-device licensing

-----

### Enterprise Browser
#### Easy: moderate setup time; some HTML and JavaScript coding required  

Enterprise Browser is a powerful, industrial browser that provides everything needed to quickly build device apps for **barcode scanning, signature capture, payment processing, printing** and most other enterprise applications for a long list of [supported Zebra devices](../about#mobile) running Android and Windows Mobile/CE. EB includes a runtime environment inside which a company's application logic can be executed and controlled using HTML5 and CSS3 for presentation and JavaScript to access EB APIs for scanners, cameras, card readers and other device peripherals. 

[Enterprise Browser](../enterprise-browser) is a small-footprint web browser for which apps can be built   

builds cross-platform scanning apps with minimal coding. 

Use EMDK for Android or EMDK for Xamarin SDKs to build or modify Java or C# apps that acquire data on Android devices. 

**PROS**: Uses familiar HTML interface; apps are cross-platform; broad device support

**CONS**: Longer setup time; some JavaScript coding; per-device licensing required

## Printing
Zebra output solutions range from simple line printing from an Enterprise Browser to the development of printer apps and firmware using Link-OS.

## Secure

### Secure an App
Zebra security ranges from simple, feature-based solutions to whole-device lock-down and encryption.

### Secure a Device

### Device Encryption

### Device Persistence
/mx/persistmgr/

### Lock Down Device Camera(s)
/mx/cameramgr/

### Create a Single-Use Device (Kiosk)
For use cases in which a device will be dedicated to a single task&mdash;such as that of an information kiosk, patient check-in system or price scanner&mdash;Zebra's Enterprise Home Screen can be used  >>> BLAH BLAH BLAH. 



Kiosk Mode also can be useful when dedicating a device to a single user and/or task, such as a retail clerk's hand-held barcode scanner. Kiosk Mode opens the app in full-screen mode and prevents exit by blocking the BACK and HOME keys.

EHS can be used with or without an Enterprise Browser app. For an concise overview of EHS configuration, see the [Device Lock-down With EHS](http://techdocs.zebra.com/enterprise-browser/1-6/guide/ehs/) section of the Enterprise Browser docs. The [EHS User Guide](http://techdocs.zebra.com/ehs/2-5/guide/features/) contains complete instructions.

## Migrating Apps
When the need arises to migrate existing apps from one device platform to another, such as from Windows CE to Android,  

Migration tools can put a new face on older apps, modernize apps for terminal emulation or help move apps from older platforms to new ones.
