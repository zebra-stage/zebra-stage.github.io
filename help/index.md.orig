## Overview

Zebra Technologies provides devices for the enterprise to acquire, process and consume data from barcodes, magnetic stripe cards, RFID tags, smart cards, images, text and other technologies. To enable Zebra partners and customers of varying skills and requirements to make use of its devices, Zebra offers a broad array of tools designed to suit the requirements and capabilities of most any organization.

## Scanning
Zebra mobile and touch computers are equipped with a variety of scanning devices, each of which can be accessed through software included with the device or with apps developed by a partner or customer. Zebra's solutions are described below in order from easiest (and with the least coding required) to the most powerful and complex.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
### DataWedge
##### PROS: Free; Easy to set up; Built into all Zebra devices; Controlled with UI or intents
##### CONS: Fixed feature set; Programmatic access requires coding
=======
### DataWedge - Add scanning to existing app
#### Easiest: minimal setup, coding optional
>>>>>>> eb-1.7

###### Zebra recommends considering DataWedge before other Zebra solutions. 

[DataWedge](../datawedge) provides barcode scanning and processing services for devices running Android, and is the fastest and easiest way to perform scanning out of the box or add it to an existing app. Included with every Zebra device, DataWedge enables any app on the device to acquire scanned data without the need to access the scanner APIs directly. DataWedge can be configured in minutes to automatically activate the desired scanner or reader whenever a particular app is launched, and can modify and pass acquired data to an app according to simple or complex rules. 

##### Go to [DataWedge docs](../datawedge)

### SimulScan
<<<<<<< HEAD
##### PROS: Easy to set up; Built into many devices; No coding required; Controlled with APIs 
##### CONS: Limited device support; Setup can be complex; Some features require licensing
=======
#### Easy: moderate setup time, coding optional 
>>>>>>> eb-1.7

[SimulScan](../simulscan) can optimize workflow by acquiring multiple points of data in a single step. It's included with [supported devices](../simulscan/1-1/guide/about/#supporteddevices) and is free for many scanning scenarios. SimulScan is well suited to organizations in which scanning is frequent and scanned forms have either one or more barcodes or contain multiple data types to acquire (such as barcodes, text and images). Optionally, SimulScan can integrate with an organization's native Android app and parse captured data directly into the app. **A per-device licensing requirement applies to some scenarios**. 

##### Go to [SimulScan docs](../simulscan)

-----

### Enterprise Browser
<<<<<<< HEAD
##### PROS: Build cross-platform apps with HTML5 that access device APIs; Broad device support
##### CONS: Requires some JavaScript coding; Longer setup times; Licensing required 
=======
#### Easy: moderate setup time; some HTML and JavaScript coding required  

Enterprise Browser is a powerful, industrial browser that provides everything needed to quickly build device apps for **barcode scanning, signature capture, payment processing, printing** and most other enterprise applications for a long list of [supported Zebra devices](../about#mobile) running Android and Windows Mobile/CE. EB includes a runtime environment inside which a company's application logic can be executed and controlled using HTML5 and CSS3 for presentation and JavaScript to access EB APIs for scanners, cameras, card readers and other device peripherals. 

[Enterprise Browser](../enterprise-browser) is a small-footprint web browser for which apps can be built   
>>>>>>> eb-1.7

[Enterprise Browser](../enterprise-browser) is a small-footprint web browser platform that uses industry-standard HTML5 for building cross-platform scanning apps with minimal coding. Runtime settings are stored in a single config file that's simple to understand, easy to modify and suitable for mass-deployment. Tools included with the platform simplify initial on-ramping and device configuration and debugging. 

##### Go to [Enterprise Browser docs](../enterprise-browser)

-----

### EMDK
##### PROS: Most customizable solution; Complete control over all source code 
##### CONS: Requires Java or C# coding; Potentially long setup and testing times

Organizations with access to Java and/or C# developers can use [EMDK for Android](../emdk-for-android) and/or [EMDK for Xamarin](../emdk-for-xamarin) SDKs to build or modify Java or C# apps that acquire data on Android devices. Both SDKs offer simplified access to device APIs through Profile Manager, which automatically generates the XML to drive Zebra's device management layer.

## Printing
Zebra output solutions range from simple line printing from an Enterprise Browser to the development of printer apps and firmware using Link-OS.

## Printing

Zebra output solutions range from simple line printing to one of [Zebra's printers](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/printers.html) to the development of printer apps and firmware using the [Link-OS Multiplatform SDK](../link-os/).

## Security

### Application Security
Zebra security ranges from simple, feature-based solutions to whole-device lock-down with or without encryption. 

**[Enterprise Home Screen](../ehs) for Android** is a simple way to control user access to apps, settings and files on Zebra devices without the need for custom code.  

**[Enterprise Browser security options](../enterprise-browser/1-7/guide/security)** protect devices and data with a variety of solutions including basic authentication, client-server certificates, encryption, kiosk mode, and settings lock-out.  

**[Zebra StageNow manages security](../stagenow/2-7/Profiles/managesecurity/)** with Zebra Mobility DNA, which can lock down peripherals, keys and ports, implement application whitelists and blacklists and set up services to monitor threats and send alerts in real time. Learn more about Zebra Mobility DNA features, which can:  
* **[Verify the signature of an app before launching](../mx/accessmgr)**
* **[Set up encryption on a device](../mx/encryptmgr/)**
* **[Control device persistence settings](../mx/persistmgr/)**
* **[Lock down one or more device cameras](../mx/cameramgr/)**
* **[Prevent use of the device Clipboard, Notification panel and other potential leaks](../mx/uimgr)**

### Whole-device Security

#### Create a Single-Use Device (Kiosk)
When a device will be dedicated to a single task&mdash;an information kiosk, patient check-in system or price scanner, for example&mdash;Zebra's Enterprise Home Screen might be a good choice. Kiosk Mode opens one app in full-screen mode and prevents exiting when BACK and HOME keys are pressed.
