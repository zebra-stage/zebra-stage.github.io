        <p>The Settings Manager (SettingsMgr) controls access to specific device capabilities in the Android System Settings panel. This allows administrators to prevent device users from changing settings that are sensitive in nature or could lead to undesired results. See <a href="/mx/accessmgr">AccessMgr</a> for other Settings panel feature restrictions. Use <a href="/mx/appmgr">AppMgr</a> to prevent access to the Settings panel entirely. </p>

<p><strong>Settings Manager controls only <em><u>access</u></em> to settings in the Android Settings panel; <em>it does not control or change the settings themselves</em></strong>. For example, if the state of Wi-Fi is "off" on a device (as set using the <a href="/mx/wifi">Wi-Fi Manager CSP</a>), using Settings Manager to disable access to Wi-Fi settings prevents a user from changing the Wi-Fi state to "on" and potentially connecting the device to a network. <!-- DELETED (as superfluous) AFTER CLARIFYING ABOVE. Conversely, if the Wi-Fi is **_on_** on a device, using Settings Manager to block access to its settings prevents a user from changing the Wi-Fi state (turning it on or off) and from altering any Wi-Fi configuration settings.--> </p>
