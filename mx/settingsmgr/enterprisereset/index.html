Since this function could lead to data loss or could render a device less functional, it may be advisable to prevent device users from invoking it.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Just because access to a Storage Card is not blocked, the Storage Card may or may not be accessible. For example, if the Storage Card is implemented by physically removable media and there is no media in the slot, then the Storage Card would not be accessible even though access to the Storage Card was enabled. Or, if the Storage Card was encrypted, and the Named Key was removed from the Key Storage Database (see the EncryptMgr), the Storage Card would not be accessible even though it was present and not blocked.</p>
