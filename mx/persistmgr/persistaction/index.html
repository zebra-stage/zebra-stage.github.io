Request XML documents must be specified using a "Persist As Name" and "Persist As Version" identifiers. The optional "Persist As Order" identifier also must be used if it was previously specified. </p>

<p>Request XML documents are Non-persistent by default, and must be designated as Persistent to remain on a device following an Enterprise Reset. Documents made Persistent are Enabled by default. Following a reset, the PersistMgr service reapplies the settings of all Request XML documents that are <strong>Persistent <em>and</em>  Enabled</strong>. Disabled Persistent documents will remain on the device following an Enterprise Reset, but their settings will not be reapplied. </p>
