        <p>Provide the path and name of the Android application APK file within the device file system that will be installed or upgraded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> An APK file can be used only to Install a User application. Any application being installed from an APK file is not built into the device and is therefore by definition a User Application. However, an APK could be used to Upgrade either a System application or a User application. For an Upgrade, the APK file must be signed with the same developer certificate as the application it is trying to replace. If the APK file is not signed with the same developer certificate, an error will be returned in the Result XML document. This means that a System application can be replaced only using an APK file produced by the same developer that produced the built-in System application. If a System application is successfully Upgraded using an APK, the new version of the application is granted the same permissions as the version that was replaced. This allows the new version of the application to successfully perform the same operations as the original System application even though it is actually a User application. Since the new version is not built into the device, the device will revert to the old built-in version of the application whenever data is cleared.</p>
