        <p>Used to enter the name of the action to be performed by the receiver(s) of the Intent. Whenever possible, the specified Action Name should be chosen from among those known to be supported by the intended receiver(s). While many Android action names are predefined, new action names can be added, making the set of possible action names effectively unlimited. Any given receiver might honor only a small subset of action names. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the set of possible Action Names is extensible, the Intent does not put specific restrictions on the Action Names that can be specified. However, Android rejects an Intent for which there is no suitable receiver. In addition, certain receivers might require permissions to be held by an application before sending Intents with certain Action Names. If an attempt is made to send an Intent that is rejected by the Android system or by a specific receiver, an error will be returned in the Result XML.</p>
