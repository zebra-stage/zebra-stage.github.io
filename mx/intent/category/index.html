A Category and Action Name combine to form a "channel" to which an app can listen for intents that use the same combination. This has the effect of filtering out the "chatter" of other intents using different value pairs. <strong>An app's intent Category is defined in its</strong> <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> <strong>file</strong>. </p>
