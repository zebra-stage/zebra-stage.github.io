        <p>Used to control access to storage on the device, which can include internal (fixed) storage and removable SD cards. When Disabled (option 1), access to all storage is completely blocked. <strong><u>IMPORTANT</u></strong>: Removable media can become inaccessible by means other than blockage by this CSP. For example, an unblocked Micro SD card is inaccessible if physically removed from the device or if encrypted and the Named Key has been removed from the Key Storage Database (see <a href="/mx/encryptmgr">EncryptMgr</a>). </p>
