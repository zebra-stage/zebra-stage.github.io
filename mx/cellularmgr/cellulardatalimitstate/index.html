        <p>This is the On/Off switch for limiting cellular data (in MB per month) on the device, and the selector for applying the Android-default or a custom limitation. When Enabled using the Android default limit, the limit is the greater of 5GB or 1.2 times the value specified in the Cellular Data Warning Value parameter, to a maximum of 1TB. If the custom limit is selected, the limit is the value specified in the Cellular Data Limit Value parameter. <strong>Once the limit is reached, the cellular data connection is terminated until a new month begins or the restriction is lifted</strong>. If no value is specified with the Cellular Data Limit Value parameter, this parameter is ignored and the previously selected Cellular Data Limit State is retained. </p>
