        <p>Used to select a JSON file on the administrator PC that contains lists of at least one Mobile Country Code (MCC) and one Mobile Network Code (MNC) to use for Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) and/or Voice over New Radio (VoNR).</p>

<p><strong>The MCC/MNC is a five- or six-digit number</strong> that first indicates the country of operation (always three numerical digits) followed by the MNC, which is either two or three digits. When combined, each entry must therefore be expressed as either XXXYY or XXXYYY (where MCC = XXX and MNC = YY or YYY).</p>
