        <p>Used to control whether the device user has access to the Data Roaming option on the device. When Disabled, Data Roaming cannot be turned on or off programmatically or by the device user. </p>

<p>The Data Roaming Option determines whether a device can communicate over cellular data networks other than the "home" network provided by the mobile operator with which the active SIM card is affiliated. <strong>The convenience of communicating over "foreign" networks while roaming must be weighed against the roaming charges imposed by foreign carriers, which can be significant</strong>.  </p>
