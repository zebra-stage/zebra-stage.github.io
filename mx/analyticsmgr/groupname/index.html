        <p>Selects the Group Name for collection of detailed metrics. The Analytics Engine in MX 5.1 can collect detailed metrics on individual feature groups as identified by the Group Names listed below. </p>

<p>When selecting a single group for data collection, a list of the metrics on which data can be collected becomes available. Data collection for each metric can be turned on or off, and each can be assigned its own condition (or threshold) that determines whether data is collected on that metric according to the frequency selected for the group. For example, an organization might wish to begin collecting data about device batteries only after a given battery's charge cycles have exceeded a number specified as optimal for maximum battery performance. Once reached, data collection will begin for that battery at the interval selected for that feature group. </p>

<p>The selected frequency for a single group applies to all metrics in the group. For example, if a 30-minute interval is selected for Smart Battery, data will be collected every 30 minutes for each enabled metric in the Smart Battery group, provided that metric has met its individual threshold (if any).</p>
