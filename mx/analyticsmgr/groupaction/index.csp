Controls whether to configure data collection by the Analytics Engine on all metrics groups, or on one or more individual groups. When configuring for all groups, only the frequency of data collection can be configured. Select "Configure Levels for a Single Group" to enable fine-grained data collection on individual metrics. When a single Group Name is selected, that group's configurable metrics will become available.  

Metrics groups are configured separately; the setting of one group has no affect on others. For example, the Analytics Manager in one instance could be configured to enable collection of WWAN Performance metrics while other groups are instructed to retain previously configured settings using the "Do not change" command. At a later time, the CSP could be called upon to collect GPS Performance metrics with all other groups given the "Do not change" command. This scenario would allow collection of both WWAN **_and_** GPS Performance metrics. Unless explicitly changed, any previously configured settings are retained.
