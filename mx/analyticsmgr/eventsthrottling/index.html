        <p>Controls the maximum number of events that the AnalyticsMgr on a device will accept from client components (such as <a href="../stats">Stats</a>) for processing and transport in any 24-hour period before generating "threshold crossed" events. It's important to note that throttling does not govern collection of events, but only the <strong>transfer</strong> of events from client components to the AnalyticsMgr. When selecting a Custom value, use an integer from 1-9999. </p>
