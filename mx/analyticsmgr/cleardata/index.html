        <p>Controls whether collected data stored on the device by the Analytics Engine and/or AnalyticsMgr CSP is cleared (erased). <strong>This function is available only when the Analytics Engine is disabled</strong>.</p>

<p>Clearing saved data can be useful when establishing a baseline for data collection during a specific period of time or under certain usage scenarios. For example, if a device has been out of contact for a period of time, clearing "old" data can avoid reports containing data that's no longer relevant or valuable. Similarly, it might sometimes be useful to clear previous data on a device just before running a test of some kind to ensure that <strong>only</strong> the data for that test is captured. </p>

<p><strong>Clear Data has no effect on Analytics data stored in the cloud</strong>. </p>
