When allowed, a USB External Storage device could have to be connected via a USB port that supports Host mode or via an OTG USB port with an OTG adapter cable or OTG compliant storage device. Use of USB External Storage could represent a security risk since it could be used as a path to extract sensitive data from a device or to inject unwanted data or applications into a device.</p>
