        <p>This is the On/Off switch for the use of Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) on the device. When this mode is enabled, a PC can connect to the device through a USB port that supports Peripheral mode or the "on-the-go" specification. Once connected, such a PC could browse exposed portions of the device file system, copy files to or from the device, or delete files. Use of this mode could represent a security risk since it could be used as a path to extract sensitive data from a device, to inject unwanted data or applications into a device, or to delete important information from a device.</p>
