When this mode is allowed, a PC can be connected to the device through a USB port that supports Peripheral mode or using an "on-the-go" (OTG) USB port. Once connected, such a PC could browse exposed portions of the device file system, copy files to or from the device, delete files, or even format an entire storage volume. <strong>Use of this mode could represent a security risk</strong> since it could be used as a path to extract sensitive data from a device, to inject unwanted data or applications into a device, or to delete important information from a device.</p>
