        <p>The USB Manager (UsbMgr) controls which USB functions can be used on the device.</p>

<p>Android devices generally have one or more Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports that can be used for various purposes. A given USB port could implement "Host" mode, which is used to connect various USB peripherals (e.g. mice, keyboards, USB storage devices) to the Android device. A given USB port could implement "Peripheral" mode, which is used to connect the Android device to a Host, such as a PC. A given USB port could implement On The Go (OTG) support, which can act in either "Host" or "Peripheral" mode, based on the cable connected.</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the default operating mode of the USB port when connecting with a host PC</li>

<li>Limit peripherals usable in USB Host Mode (see below)</li>

<li>Allow or prevent use of the following:


<ul>
<li>All modes and functions of USB</li>

<li>External USB storage devices</li>

<li>Connection to a PC via ADB (Android Debug Bridge)</li>

<li>All access by a PC to device storage via USB</li>

<li>Access by a PC to device storage using USB Mass Storage (UMS) via USB</li>

<li>Access by a PC to device storage using Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) via USB</li>

<li>Access by a PC to device storage using Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) via USB</li>

<li>Access by a device to designated USB peripherals only (See USB Host Mode)</li>

<li>Automatic launching of a designated app upon connection of a specific USB peripheral or type</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Controls whether to allow all USB peripherals to be used when the device is in USB Host Mode or to restrict usage to peripherals as defined in Rules created by the administrator. Works with <a href="#control-rules">Control Rules</a> parameter.  </p>

<p>On devices with MX 11.5 and later, MX allows an administrator to control which USB peripherals can be used by the mobile device when in Host Mode. Allowed peripherals can be categorized by device class, vendor ID (VID), product ID (PID) as described in an XML-based list of rules created by the administrator. See <a href="#host-mode-peripherals">Host Mode Peripherals</a> for more information. </p>
