        <p>Used to enter a number of percentage points (from 10–30) to dim the screen brightness from its current level. For example, entering 30 reduces the brightness to 50 percent on a device previously set at 80 percent. <strong>Screen brightness is NEVER set to less than 30 percent</strong>, regardless of values entered in this parameter or current brightness level of device when this parameter is applied.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>If Adaptive Brightness is DISABLED</strong> when parameter is applied:


<ul>
