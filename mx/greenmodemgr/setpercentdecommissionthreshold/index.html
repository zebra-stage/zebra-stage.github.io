        <p>Used to set the Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold on devices that support Gifted Batteries. A Gifted Battery is considered "ready to be decommissioned" if its Battery Health is less than the currently configured Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold. The default value for this parameter is 75, indicating that a Smart Battery should be decommissioned once its Actual Capacity is less than 75 percent of its original Rated Capacity.</p>

<p>Gifted Batteries can determine their "Actual Capacity" under specific discharge conditions. Based on this, Gifted Batteries can estimate their Battery Health as the percentage the Actual Capacity is of the "Rated Capacity." Over time, the Actual Capacity and the Battery Health will diminish, and it's reasonable to expect that a battery with a lower Battery Health has a shorter remaining useful lifetime than a device with greater Battery Health.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This parameter can be used on Zebra Android devices that support Gifted Batteries regardless of whether a Gifted Battery is currently installed in the device. This allows administrators to configure the decommission threshold for devices currently using Smart Batteries in advance of installing Gifted ones. If this parameter is used on a device that does not support Gifted Batteries, an error will be returned in the Result XML document.</p>
