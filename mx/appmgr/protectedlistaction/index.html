<p>An app with its Package Name on the Protected List is allowed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch when no device user is logged in</li>

<li>Remain running when a device user logs out</li>

<li>Maintain a single copy of data accessible by all users, even if Multi-User Data Separation is enabled</li>

</ul>

<!-- 
2/17/20- Added info: below when Protected mode was removed from MX 9.3. PUT BACK when it returned in (9.3 rev.1). 

info: This feature is discontinued in MX 9.3 and higher. 

8/20/20 MX MU discontnued. Per eng, removed "imposed when Multi-User Mode is enabled."

8/5/19- Zebra Multi-user mode is discontinued. Note removed to eliminate confusion with Android MU mode. 
**Note:** Multi-User Mode is supported on all Zebra Android devices that support Zebra MX functionality, but the AccessMgr cannot currently enable it. Enabling Multi-User Mode currently is done using unsupported tools or mechanisms that might not scale to large deployments. For this reason, the ability to use the AppMgr to manage the Protected List provides limited benefit.
