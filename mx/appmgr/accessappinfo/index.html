        <p>Since the AppMgr allows control of which applications are installed, it may be of concern that a device user can use the App Info section of the in-device System Settings Menu to impact an installed application.  A device user might terminate an application (Force Stop), remove application data (Clear Data), etc.  A device user might also Uninstall the application completely.  If an MDM is being used to tightly control the set of installed applications on a device, such activities by a device user might be undesirable.</p>

<p>This may be compounded by the fact that the App Info section of the System Settings Menu may be reached from a variety of places in the device UI, not just from the main System Settings Menu.  For example, App Info can be reached for an application from the Android Recent Applications List or from a notification related to the application in the Android Notification Area.</p>

<p>To prevent device users from using App Info to alter the configured set of installed applications, it may be desirable to prevent the device user from accessing App Info altogether.  Of course, you could use the AppMgr to disable launching of the System Settings Menu application, which would prevent access to App Info.  But that would also prevent access to all other aspects of the System Settings Menu.  A more targeted approach would be to block only App Info.</p>

<p>This allows you to enable or disable all access to App Info for all applications without blocking access to other parts of the System Settings Menu.  By disabling App Info, you can prevent the device user from getting to App Info and using it to interfere with the configured set of installed applications.</p>
