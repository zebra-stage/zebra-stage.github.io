        <p>Application Manager (AppMgr) administers the user applications on the device. It can be used to programmatically install, uninstall, upgrade and turn on (or off) the ability to launch an application, all with no need for user interaction. AppMgr also can designate an application as the Default Launcher (invoked when pressing the HOME Key), and can perform other tasks related to the management of applications.</p>

<p>On consumer Android devices, app management generally requires the user to interact with a management UI presented on the device. For corporate scenarios involving management by an Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) system (sometimes referred to as mobile device management, or MDM), user consent or approval might nto be desired as they potentially limit a company's ability to fully control the user apps installed on a device. AppMgr provides such control. </p>

<p>When considering the capabilities of AppMgr, it is important to understand the difference between System apps and User apps. System applications are built into the device and always by default. User applications are not built in, and must be installed before use. Some AppMgr functions apply only to System apps, some only to User apps, and some to both. Each function identifies the class of the app(s) to which it applies.</p>

<p>The App Manager provides a feature to block an App from inclusion in Doze Mode (and App Standby) in the form of an "Exemption Whitelist"  - their presentation actually used that expression - "Exemption Whitelist".
And this tells the same story, "An app holding the REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS permission can trigger a system dialog to let the user add the app to the whitelist directly."  Not too many ways to read that...
Also, Google docs state "By default, all Apps are subject to Doze/App Standby". As such, a Whitelist to "apply Battery Optimization" is pointless.</p>

<p>BatteryOptimization Action description:
Allows one or more apps to be added or removed from the "Doze Mode exemption" list, determining whether the device is allowed to enter a power saving mode while the app is running.</p>

<p>So, clearly the intention of this feature is to exempt the Battery Optimization Whitelisted Apps from suffering the effects of Doze, not to flag them as Apps to apply those effects to. </p>

<p>DOZE MODE desc.
This is the On/Off switch for Doze Mode energy saving features on the device. When Doze Mode is enabled, only apps specifically "whitelisted" on the device can prevent the device from entering this low-power state. Apps are designated as such using the App Manager CSP.</p>
