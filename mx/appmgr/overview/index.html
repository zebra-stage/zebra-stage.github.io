        <p>Application Manager (AppMgr) administers the user applications on the device. It can be used to programmatically install, uninstall, upgrade and turn on (or off) the ability to launch an application, all with no need for user interaction. AppMgr also can designate an application as the Default Launcher (invoked when pressing the HOME Key), and can perform other tasks related to the management of applications.</p>

<p>On consumer Android devices, app management generally requires the user to interact with a management UI presented on the device. For corporate scenarios involving management by an Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) system (sometimes referred to as mobile device management, or MDM), user consent or approval might not be desired as they potentially limit a company's ability to fully control the user apps installed on a device. AppMgr provides such control. </p>

<p>When considering the capabilities of AppMgr, it is important to understand the difference between System apps and User apps. System applications are built into the device and always by default. User applications are not built in, and must be installed before use. Some AppMgr functions apply only to System apps, some only to User apps, and some to both. Each function identifies the class of the app(s) to which it applies.</p>

  <p><strong>GMS Restricted Mode</strong>: In response to security concerns, Zebra has implemented GMS Restricted Mode, which allows administrators to disable some or all GMS apps deemed "safe to disable" without interfering with normal device operations. See <a href="/mx/gmsmgr">GMS Manager</a> for more information. </p>

  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>The use of the</strong> <code>/enterprise</code> <strong>partition is deprecated, and <u>will eventually be prohibited</u></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Zebra recommends switching as soon as possible to the SSM-based approach, which uses Zebra's <a href="/ssm/latest/guide/deploy/">Secure Storage Manager</a> to securely store, share and persist apps, config files and data on a device</strong>. Changes for using this method are minimal. Instead of specifying an on-device path for file deployment, files are deployed through SSM using an app-specific URI. <strong>For complete staging instructions, see <a href="/stagenow/latest/ssmusage">Using SSM with AppMgr and FileMgr</a></strong>. </p>

<h3 id="apppermissions" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#apppermissions"><span></span></a>App Permissions</h3>

<p>The evolving security practices employed by Android have changed the user experience in Android 10 to give greater control to the device user. Such changes could impact the enterprise use cases of Zebra customers. To implement the necessary functionality while maintaining device security, MX 10.0 provides the IT administrator with the ability to silently (without device-user interaction) grant application runtime permissions typically used by remote management systems. <strong>For some of the Actions executed by this CSP, including Install and Upgrade, apps must be targeted at Android API level 23</strong> (or newer) to be silently granted runtime permissions on devices running Android 10 or later.</p>

<h3 id="batteryoptimization" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#batteryoptimization"><span></span></a>Battery Optimization</h3>

<p>The App Manager allows one or more apps to be added to the Battery Optimization "exemption whitelist." While running, apps on this list prevent the device from entering Doze and App Standby power saving modes, thereby preserving their ability to continue functioning and/or providing services. Doze mode conserves battery power by deferring background CPU and network activities when the device is idle. App Standby defers background network activity for apps with which the user has not recently interacted. By default, all non-system apps are subject to Doze and App Standby modes unless added to the whitelist. </p>
