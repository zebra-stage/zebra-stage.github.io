  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>DO NOT USE THIS PARAMETER if the desired behavior is to <u>ALLOW</u> Doze Mode</strong>. On devices running Android 7.x and later, all apps by default allow the device to enter Doze Mode to maximize battery life. Designating one or more apps using this parameter prevents the device from entering Doze Mode whenever those app(s) are in the foreground.</p>
