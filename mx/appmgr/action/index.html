Disabled keyboards do not appear for selection in the Android Settings panel. See the Overview section for a <a href="#virtualkeyboards">list of virtual keyboards</a>.</li>

<li>On some older devices, <strong><u>"Protected" Apps remain on the "Recent Apps" list after the list has been cleared</u> using the "ClearRecentApps" Action</strong>.<br>See Protected List Action parameter for more information.</li>

<li><strong>When persisting the DisableGMSApps Action across an Enterprise Reset, <u>the Action MUST be preceded by a bypass of the Android Setup Wizard</u></strong> to prevent unpredictable behavior. See <a href="/mx/powermgr/#suppress-reboot">Power Manager</a> for more information. </li>

<li>Perform the device upgrade with a package containing MX 8.3 or later.</li>

<li>Perform "Restricted" GMS Manager Action.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends Zebra recommends restarting the device following any Action that enables GMS restrictions</strong>.</li>

<li>If desired, use Persist Manager to safeguard the XML on the device.<br>
<strong><u>NOTE</u>: It is not possible to transition a device to a new OS <em>and</em> to implement GMS Restricted mode using a single XML profile</strong>.</li></ul>

<!-- 2/18/20- Per TUT-38260, added note yesterday, per eng. Removed it today, per eng. 
* **<u>On devices running Android 10 Q</u> (and later), the DisableGMSApps Action does *NOT* disable the Google Quick Search app** (`com.google.android.quicksearchbox`) as on prior Android versions. Use the DisableApplication Action instead.
