        <p>Used to specify the Action to perform on an application or app-related setting or action. Actions can apply only to System apps, only to User apps, or to both (as noted in the table below). </p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong><u>"Protected" Apps remain on the "Recent Apps" list after the list has been cleared</u> using the "ClearRecentApps" Action</strong>.<br>See Protected List Action parameter for more information.</li>

<li><strong>When persisting the DisableGMSApps Action across an Enterprise Reset, <u>the Action MUST be preceded by a bypass of the Android Setup Wizard</u></strong> to prevent unpredictable behavior. See <a href="/mx/powermgr/#setup-wizard-bypass">Power Manager</a> for more information. </li>

<li><strong>EnableGMSApps and DisableGMSApps Actions are supported only on SDM660-platform devices, which includes (but is not limited to)</strong>:


<ul>
<li>PS20</li>

<li>TC52</li>

<li>TC57</li>

<li>TC72</li>

<li>TC77</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong><code>IMPORTANT:</code> If upgrading a device to gain access to "GMS Restricted" mode (implemented in MX 8.3 and later)</strong>, the upgrade and related actions must be performed in the following order: 


<ul>
<li>If apps were previously disabled using the "DisableGMSApps" App Manager Action, execute the "EnableGMSApps" App Manager Action. </li>

<li>Perform the device upgrade with a package containing MX 8.3 or later.</li>

<li>Perform "Restricted" GMS Manager Action.</li>

<li>If desired, use Persist Manager to safeguard the XML on the device.<br>
<strong><code>NOTE:</code> It is not possible to transition a device to a new OS <em>and</em> to implement GMS Restricted mode with the same XML profile</strong>.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
