<ul>
<li><strong><code>IMPORTANT:</code> See <a href="#overview">Overview section</a> regarding changes to Android 10 permissions</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Virtual keyboards (aka soft input panels) are enabled and disabled in the same way as apps</strong>, by referenceing their package name with the desired AppMgr Action. Disabled keyboards do not appear for selection in the Android Settings panel. See the Overview section for a <a href="#virtualkeyboards">list of virtual keyboards</a>.</li>

<li>On some older devices, <strong><u>"Protected" Apps remain on the "Recent Apps" list after the list has been cleared</u> using the "ClearRecentApps" Action</strong>.<br>See Protected List Action parameter for more information.</li>

<li><strong>When persisting the DisableGMSApps Action across an Enterprise Reset, <u>the Action MUST be preceded by a bypass of the Android Setup Wizard</u></strong> to prevent unpredictable behavior. See <a href="/mx/powermgr/#suppress-reboot">Power Manager</a> for more information. </li>

<li><strong>EnableGMSApps and DisableGMSApps Actions are supported only on SDM660-platform devices, which includes (but is not limited to)</strong>:

<li><strong><code>IMPORTANT:</code> If upgrading a device to gain access to "GMS Restricted" mode (implemented in MX 8.3 and later)</strong>, the upgrade and related actions must be performed in the following order: 


<ul>
<li>If apps were previously disabled using the "DisableGMSApps" App Manager Action, execute the "EnableGMSApps" App Manager Action. </li>

<li>Perform the device upgrade with a package containing MX 8.3 or later.</li>

<li>Perform "Restricted" GMS Manager Action.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends Zebra recommends restarting the device following any Action that enables GMS restrictions</strong>.</li>

<li>If desired, use Persist Manager to safeguard the XML on the device.<br>
<strong><code>NOTE:</code> It is not possible to transition a device to a new OS <em>and</em> to implement GMS Restricted mode with the same XML profile</strong>.</li></ul>
</li>

<!-- 2/18/20- Per TUT-38260, added note yesterday, per eng. Removed it today, per eng. 
* **<u>On devices running Android 10 Q</u> (and later), the DisableGMSApps Action does *NOT* disable the Google Quick Search app** (`com.google.android.quicksearchbox`) as on prior Android versions. Use the DisableApplication Action instead.
