Used to enable/disable the Save Form Data Option of the default Android web browser. 

Enabling Save Form Data can make browsing more convenient by eliminating the need for the device user to re-enter information on subsequent visits to a form. Disabling Save Form Data is generally more secure, especially on a device that might be shared, since it would prevent an unauthorized user viewing or re-entering sensitive information that was previously entered by an authorized user.
