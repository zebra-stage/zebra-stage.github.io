        <p>The CameraMgr controls access to camera(s) and other mechanisms on the device that are capable of capturing images. Many Zebra Android products are equipped with devices that can be used to take pictures, scan barcodes or otherwise capture or acquire data, documents and images. For secure environments, CameraMgr can be used to restrict picture-taking and document capture and eliminate potential security risks posed by cameras and non-camera devices.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Any mechanism on a device that can be used to take pictures or otherwise capture images is treated as a camera by CameraMgr. For example, if a device is equipped with a CCD-based imager that is intended primarily to scan barcodes but also supports some means to take pictures, that imager's picture-taking capabilities can be disabled with the UseAllCameras (enable/disable) parameter. Its barcode scanning capabilities will remain operational if doing so does not expose the ability to take pictures. If such a device offers only the ability to scan barcodes, it would not be treated as a camera since it poses little risk to image security. </p>

<h3 id="mainfunctionality" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#mainfunctionality"><span></span></a>Main Functionality</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enable/disable the use of all cameras and image-capture devices</li>

<li>Enable/disable the front-facing camera</li>

<li>Enable/disable the rear-facing camera</li>

<li>Enable/disable the imager camera</li>

<li>Report which cameras and image-capture devices are enabled/disabled</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#notes"><span></span></a>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Capturing images from the Imager using Camera APIs is not supported on devices running Android 8.x (Oreo)</strong> or later.</li>

<li>Limited support for picture-taking using non-camera devices may be available on devices running Android 5.x or later.</li>

<li>Blocking some or all cameras also might inhibit barcode scanning using those cameras if barcode scanning would directly or indirectly expose the ability to take pictures.</li>

<li>Blocking some or all cameras also might inhibit use of SimulScan using those cameras since some or all functions of SimulScan might rely on or expose the ability to take pictures.</li>

<li>Blocking the imager on devices running Android 5.x disables SimulScan. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="zebracameraapp" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#zebracameraapp"><span></span></a>Zebra Camera App</h3>

<p>The Zebra Camera App is a new image capture app pre-installed on all Zebra devices running Android 13 and on some devices running Android 11 (see below). ZCA can be remotely configured by pushing a JSON file using File Manager through Zebra DNA Cloud, Zebra StageNow, or a company's own EMM system. Instructions and configurable parameters can be found below. </p>

<h4 id="requirements" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#requirements"><span></span></a>Requirements</h4>

<h3 id="samplejson" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#samplejson"><span></span></a>Sample JSON</h3>

<p>The sample <code>config.json</code> file below when pushed to the device sets the Zebra Camera App according to the settings shown. Settings are subject to the notes and behaviors shown below. </p>

<h4 id="deployment" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#deployment"><span></span></a>Deployment</h4>

<ol>
<li>Make changes to config.json values to fit desired configurations </li>

<li>Either push the file to SDCard or on FTP </li>

<li>Generate ZVA profile using FileMgrCSP to deploy this file for ZebraCameraApp </li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>3.1 Target Application and Filename will be: "com.symbol.zcam/files/config.json" </li>

<li>3.2 Rest of the values can be filled according source if SDCard or FTP see FileMgrCSP documentation </li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Once ZVA profile is ready apply it to device either by scanning barcode in Stagenow or via OEMConfig </li>

<li>Launch Zebra Camera App and the configurations should be applied</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notesandbehaviors" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#notesandbehaviors"><span></span></a>Notes and Behaviors</h4>

<p>A <code>config.json</code> file containing all supported values will be provided (see below). </p>

<p>Admin applying configurations to Zebra Camera App will can follow the steps listed: </p>

<p>General Guidelines </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Value Definition 
    1.1. enable : Setting will be user accessible 
    1.2. disable : Setting will be greyed out and user won't be able to change it 
    1.3. on : Setting will be turned on, except in case of flash it will be set to Always on 
    1.4. off : Setting will be turned off, except in case of flash it will be set to Always off 
    1.5. auto : Only available for flash, sets the option to auto </p></li>

<li><p>Always replace the values within quotes, e.g. "value1" to "value2", if json is formed incorrectly logs will indicate that </p></li>

<li><p>Configuration that is not supported by device will be ignored, e.g. GoogleLens, HDR are platform specific and may not be available on all devices</p>
