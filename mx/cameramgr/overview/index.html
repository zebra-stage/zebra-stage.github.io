        <p>The CameraMgr controls access to camera(s) and other mechanisms on the device that are capable of capturing images. Many Zebra Android products are equipped with devices that can be used to take pictures, scan barcodes or otherwise capture or acquire data, documents and images. For secure environments, CameraMgr can be used to restrict picture-taking and document capture and eliminate potential security risks posed by cameras and non-camera devices.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Any mechanism on a device that can be used to take pictures or otherwise capture images is treated as a camera by CameraMgr. For example, if a device is equipped with a CCD-based imager that is intended primarily to scan barcodes but also supports some means to take pictures, that imager's picture-taking capabilities can be disabled with the UseAllCameras (enable/disable) parameter. Its barcode scanning capabilities will remain operational if doing so does not expose the ability to take pictures. If such a device offers only the ability to scan barcodes, it would not be treated as a camera since it poses little risk to image security. </p>

<h3 id="notes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#notes"><span></span></a>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Capturing images from the Imager using Camera APIs is not supported on devices running Android 8.x (Oreo)</strong> or later.</li>

<li>Limited support for picture-taking using non-camera devices may be available on devices running Android 5.x or later.</li>

<li>Blocking some or all cameras also might inhibit barcode scanning using those cameras if barcode scanning would directly or indirectly expose the ability to take pictures.</li>

<li>Blocking some or all cameras also might inhibit use of SimulScan using those cameras since some or all functions of SimulScan might rely on or expose the ability to take pictures.</li>

<li>Blocking the imager on devices running Android 5.x disables SimulScan. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Zebra Camera App (ZCA) is an image capture app pre-installed on most Zebra devices (see below). ZCA settings can be configured locally by the device user or remotely by pushing a JSON file to the device (which overrides user-configured settings). <strong>Some parameters also can be configured to prevent changes by the user</strong>. Instructions and configurable parameters are shown below. </p>

<h3 id="imagequalityscreener" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#imagequalityscreener"><span></span></a>Image Quality Screener</h3>

<p><strong>Zebra Camera App 2.5.13 introduces Zebra Image Quality Screener (IQS)</strong>, a feature designed to improve the quality of images captured by device users. IQS uses AI to analyze captured images for blurriness—such as from motion or improper focus—and prompts the user to retake any image that exceeds a predetermined threshold set by the user or administrator based on organizational requirements. </p>

<p><img alt="image" style="height:400px" src="../../../../../images/mx/ZCA_capture.png">
<br></p>

<h4 id="performance" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#performance"><span></span></a>Performance</h4>

<ul>
<li>Blurriness evaluations by IQS were within 0.6 points* of the same images judged by Zebra testers</li>

<li>Blurriness of a 16 MP image (Zebra default) requires between 300 and 400 ms to evaluate with IQS<i>†</i></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="imagecapturesupport" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#imagecapturesupport"><span></span></a>Image/Capture Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Still images saved as JPEG (<code>.jpg</code>) file format</li>

<li>Single-image capture only</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="usagenotes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#usagenotes"><span></span></a>Usage Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Images intended for <strong>OCR or barcode decoding</strong> generally require a <strong><u>lower</u> threshold of sharpness</strong> for success.</li>

<li>Images intended for <strong>product recognition</strong> generally require a <strong><u>higher</u> threshold of sharpness</strong> for success.</li>

<li><strong>Poor or inaccurate blurriness scores can be caused by</strong>: <br>


<ul>
<li>Images that include areas with <strong>little or no texture</strong> (blank white wall, open sky, etc.) </li>

<li><strong>Close-up shots</strong> that include large low-focus areas outside the subject</li>

<li>Use of features such as <strong>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</strong> or <strong>Multi-frame Noise Reduction (MFNR)</strong></li>

<li>Burst-capture and continuous-shot modes are not supported</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><i><font size="2" color="DimGrey"> * Blurriness is evaluated using a scale of 1-5 (1=blurry, 5=sharp).</font></i><br> 
<i><font size="2" color="DimGrey"> † Results vary by device processor and image size; all IQS evaluations are performed on-device.</font></i> </p>
