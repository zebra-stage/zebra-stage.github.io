        <p>Used to select the type(s) of field(s) to display in a user Dialog, the "questionnaire" displayed to the user whenever a bug report is generated. Such Dialogs can be useful for gathering information about user activities that might have led to or caused the malfunction being reported. <strong>The construction of the Dialog is cumulative; any number of user-entry fields (Text Boxes) and field Labels can be added until all desired questions are asked and all data-gathering needs are addressed</strong>. See the <a href="#overview">Overview section</a> (above) for more information about the way these fields are used and displayed on the device. </p>

<p><strong>Note: To ensure proper operation, each new Dialog must begin with a 'ClearDialog' Action and end with a 'LayoutEnd' Action</strong>.</p>
