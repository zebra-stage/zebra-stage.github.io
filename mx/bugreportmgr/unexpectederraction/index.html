        <p>Controls whether an error report is captured when an app crashes unexpectedly (non-ANR), and which type of report (Bug Report/logcat) is captured. A Bug Report contains information described in the <a href="#overview">Overview</a> section above. The Android system log (sometimes called "logcat" after the command used to retrieve it) stores system messages, stack traces and log information written by apps running at the time of the crash. </p>

  <p><strong>SECURITY WARNING</strong>: Bug reports contain app-usage, location and other data from system logs that might be considered sensitive. They should be shared only with trusted people and apps. </p>
