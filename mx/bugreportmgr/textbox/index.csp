Used to add one or more blank text fields to capture input from the user that describes the issue being reported. The Text Box allows an administrator to include "hint" text to help guide the user toward the desired input (i.e. "App being used"). Hint text populates the otherwise blank text field and disappears the moment the user begins typing. In the generated bug report, hint text becomes the label for data entered by the user in that field. 

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String of at least 1 character containing a description of the issue being reported
