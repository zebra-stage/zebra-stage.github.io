<p><strong>StageNow limits file size to 2GB for FTP transfers</strong> from the workstation to devices. To transfer files larger than 2GB to devices, use the following process to deploy from an external staging server: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Transfer the large file(s) to an external server</strong> capable of processing FTP/S or HTTP/S requests for downloads.</li>

<li><strong>Specify the location of each file using the <a href="#new-source-uri">Source URI2</a> parameter</strong> (seen here as "New Source URI") in the settings Profile. </li>

<h3 id="usingssm" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#usingssm"><span></span></a>Using SSM</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>The use of the</strong> <code>/enterprise</code> <strong>partition is discouraged, and <u>could violate future Google security rules</u></strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Zebra recommends switching as soon as possible to the SSM-based approach, which uses Zebra's <a href="/ssm/latest/guide/deploy/">Secure Storage Manager</a> to securely store, share and persist apps, config files and data on a device</strong>. Changes for using this method are minimal. Instead of specifying an on-device path for file deployment, files are deployed through SSM using an app-specific URI. <strong>For complete staging instructions, see <a href="/stagenow/latest/ssmusage">Using SSM with AppMgr and FileMgr</a></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>SSM is compatible with MX 11.3</strong> (and later; MX 11.9 is recommended) and its processes were designed to be transparent to the administrator in many file- and/or data-sharing scenarios. However, <strong><u>apps designated as the recipient of files and/or data shared through SSM must be able to <a href="/oeminfo/consume/">access a file via URI</a></u></strong>. Such changes would be required not specifically for working with Zebra devices, but for compliance with Android security mandates that will eventually be required of all Android devices sharing data. </p>

<h4 id="requiredparameters" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#requiredparameters"><span></span></a>Required Parameters</h4>

<p><strong>File Action Option 10 (in the table below) requires (or optionally works with, as indicated) these additional parameters</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TargetApplicationAndFileName (required)</strong> provides a "Target Application File Definition," which combines the target app name, optional target-app folder and file name in the format:


<ul>
<li><code>com.targetApp.package.name/optionalAppFolderName/file.name</code> (see notes, below)</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>TargetApplicationSignature (required)</strong> verifies that the "target" app (with which the file is being shared) is genuine </li>

<li><strong>SourceAccessMethod2 (required)</strong> provides the location of the file being shared to be copied/transferred to the device<br>
<i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color:#27AE60;"></i> For added security, Zebra recommends selecting the "File on remote server" option (see SourceURI2, below)</li>

<li><strong>SourceURI2</strong> provides the server location of file being shared (<strong>required if using the "File on remote server" option</strong>)<br></li>

<li><strong>PersistFile (optional)</strong> allows copied data and/or file to securely persist following an Enterprise Reset</li>

<li><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>When exporting a StageNow Profile that contains any "ExternalURI" field, data in that field is encrypted.<br> <u>If a Profile containing an encrypted field is imported, contents of that field cannot be edited</u></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abouttargetapplicationfiledefinition" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#abouttargetapplicationfiledefinition"><span></span></a>About Target Application File Definition</h4>

<p>The "Target Application File Definition" parameter (aka 'TargetApplicationAndFileName') accepts a combination of an app's package name (<code>com.targetApp.package.name</code> in the example above), and the name of the file (<code>file.name</code>) being shared. This file can be an app installer package (<code>.apk</code>) for installation on the device, a config file for configuring app settings, or any other type of file. </p>

<p>The middle section of the definition (<code>/optionalAppFolderName/</code>) is an <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> folder (or path) under the target app (or created there if it did not already exist) that can be used to organize files for the target app. <u>This storage area is accessible only by the designated target app</u>, which can be another app on the device or the target app itself. </p>

  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>Any app intended to receive data shared through SSM must be capable of <u><a href="/oeminfo/consume/">consuming data via URI</a></u></strong>.<br> <br>
