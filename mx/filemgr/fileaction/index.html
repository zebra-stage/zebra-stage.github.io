<p><strong>In preparation for Google-mandated security restrictions being phased in starting with Android 11</strong>, Zebra has implemented <a href="/ssm">Secure Storage Manager (SSM)</a>, a mechanism for securely sharing files and/or data from an originating app to a target app in compliance with Android security mandates. <strong>In this process, direct file access is no longer permitted, and minor <u>changes are required to ANY app intended to receive data shared through SSM</u></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>SSM is compatible with the File Manger CSP delivered with MX 11.3</strong> (and later) and its processes were designed to be transparent to the administrator in many file- and/or data-sharing scenarios. However, <strong><u>apps designated as the recipient of files and/or data shared through SSM must be able to <a href="/oeminfo/consume/">access a file via URI</a></u></strong>. Such changes would be required not specifically for working with Zebra devices, but for compliance with Android security mandates that will eventually be required of all Android devices sharing data. </p>

<h4 id="requiredparameters" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#requiredparameters"><span></span></a>Required Parameters</h4>

<p><strong>File Action Option 10 (in the table, below) requires (or optionally works with, as indicated) these additional parameters</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TargetApplicationAndFileName (required)</strong> provides a "Target Application File Definition," which combines the target app name, optional target-app folder and file name in the format:


<ul>
<li><code>com.targetApp.package.name/optionalAppFolderName/file.name</code> (see notes, below)</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>TargetApplicationSignature (required)</strong> verifies that the "target" app (with which the file is being shared) is genuine </li>

<li><strong>SourceAccessMethod2 (required)</strong> provides the location of the file being shared to be copied/transferred to the device<br>
<i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color:#27AE60;"></i> For added security, Zebra recommends selecting the "File on remote server" option (see SourceURI2, below)</li>

<li><strong>SourceURI2</strong> provides the server location of file being shared (<strong>required if using the "File on remote server" option</strong>)<br></li>

<li><strong>PersistFile (optional)</strong> allows copied data and/or file to securely persist following an Enterprise Reset</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="abouttargetapplicationfiledefinition" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#abouttargetapplicationfiledefinition"><span></span></a>About Target Application File Definition</h4>

<p>The "Target Application File Definition" parameter (aka 'TargetApplicationAndFileName') accepts a combination of an app's package name (<code>com.targetApp.package.name</code> in the example above), and the name of the file (<code>file.name</code>) being shared. This file can be an app installer package (.apk) for installation on the device, a config file for configuring app settings, or any other type of file. </p>

<p>The middle section of the definition (<code>/optionalAppFolderName/</code>) is an <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> folder (or path) under the target app (or created there if it did not already exist) that can be used to organize files for the target app. <u>This storage area is accessible only by the designated target app</u>, which can be another app on the device or the target app itself. </p>
