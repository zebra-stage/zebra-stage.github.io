        <p>The File Manager (FileMgr) allows an application to manage files on the device. For example, FileMgr permits an app to download a file from a server to the device, copy a file or folder from one area of the device to another and to delete files on the device. The File Manager also can extract files embedded within an XML document and download from the internet with or without basic authentication. </p>
