        <p><strong>The Network Connection Manager (NetworkConnectionMgr) allows an administrator to set preferences for device connection to cellular (WWAN) and Wi-Fi (WLAN) networks to help ensure that devices use the optimal network at all times</strong>. NetworkConnectionMgr allows administrators to manage and deploy lists of access points for wireless networks, rank them in order of priority, and/or set minimum signal levels when establishing connections with a set time interval for attempting to improve connections. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> NetworkConnectionMgr is supported only on devices equipped with both WLAN <strong><em>and</em></strong> WWAN radios. </p>
