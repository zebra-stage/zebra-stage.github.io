        <p>Used to enter the minimum signal level (in dBm) for connection to a cellular (WWAN) network. Values range from -156 dBm (weak) to -31 dBm (strong). A value of "0" (default) is ignored, causing no change to any current value.</p>

<p><strong>Parm input value rules</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>String between "-156" (weak) and "-31" (strong) representing WWAN signal strength in dBm </li>

<li>Entering "0" causes no change to current value, if any</li>
