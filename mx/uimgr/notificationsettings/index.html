        <p>This parm value controls whether Quick Settings icons will be displayed in the Android Notifications panel. Quick Settings icons provide immediate access to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and other commonly used System settings without having to go through the Settings panel. The Notifications panel is accessed from most applications by dragging downward from the Notification/Status bar at the top of the Android screen. Hiding the Quick Settings icons can prevent a device user from accessing those Quick Settings and changing device behavior. </p>
