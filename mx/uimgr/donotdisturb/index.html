        <p>This is the On/Off switch for "Do Not Disturb" (DND) mode on the device, which toggles app notification sounds and messages. When Turn On (option 1) is selected, all device notifications are muted. </p>

<p><strong><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> This parameter does NOT prevent the device user from changing the state of DND mode using the Android Settings panel</strong>. </p>
