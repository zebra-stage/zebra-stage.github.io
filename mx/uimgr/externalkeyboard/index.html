<p><strong>On devices with MX 13.2 or later, wildcard characters can be used to identify keyboards for application of an Action</strong>. For example, if all keyboards in an organization contain the word "BrandX" but otherwise differ by model, applying an Action to the name "brandx<b>*</b>" applies to all keyboards with names containing that string. In addition, if the selected language is "Automatic" while adding the Keyboard Layout Mapping, the device locale is automatically set whenever the keyboard is connected.</p>
