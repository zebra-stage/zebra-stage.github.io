        <p>This is the On/Off switch for the on-screen Navigation Bar, which contains the BACK, HOME and RECENT soft keys. Disabling the Navigation Bar can prevent the user from exiting the currently running app by means of those keys. This parameter applies only to the soft keys; it does not control capacitive or hardware keys, which can be disabled separately using the <a href="/mx/keymappingmgr">Keymapping Manager</a>. <strong>Also see the Recent App Button Usage parameter</strong> elsewhere on this page. </p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: On some devices running Android 13, enabling or disabling the Navigation Bar from within an app triggers a configuration change that might restart the app's main activity. To prevent this, add the attribute <code>android:configChanges="screenSize|screenLayout"</code> to the activity tag in the app's manifest file as in the highlighted section of the image below. </p>
