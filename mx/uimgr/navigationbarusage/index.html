        <p>This is the On/Off switch for the on-screen Navigation Bar, which contains the BACK, HOME and RECENT soft keys. Disabling the Navigation Bar prevents the user from quitting the currently running app by means of those keys. <strong>This parameter applies only to the soft keys; it does not control capacitive or hardware keys, which can be disabled separately using the <a href="../keymappingmgr">Keymapping Manager</a></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Also see the Recent App Button Usage parameter</strong> elsewhere on this page. </p>
