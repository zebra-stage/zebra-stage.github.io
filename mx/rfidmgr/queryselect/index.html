        <p>Used to select the desired tags during a query operation when multiple tags are within scanning range. Queries support "all tags," or those with "SL asserted" or "SL de-asserted" flags, irrespective of session. Use of this parameter can help improve scanning performance and avoid the "noise" of decoding unwanted tags. An SL flag is asserted when its SL flag has been set using the Select command. Flags not designated as such are considered de-asserted. </p>
