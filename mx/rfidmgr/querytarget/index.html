        <p>Used to determine during a query operation whether a Tag with an inventoried flag (A or B) is selected in a session when multiple tags are within scanning range. When using this parameter, flags can change from "A" to "B" or vice-versa. Use of this parameter can help improve scanning performance and avoid the "noise" of decoding unwanted tags.</p>
