        <p>Used to select the desired tags during a query operation when multiple tags are within scanning range. When using this parameter, queries in a scanning session can recognize tags flagged in one of four sessions: S0, S1, S2 or S3, each with an "A" or "B" designation. Use of this parameter can help improve scanning performance and avoid the "noise" of decoding unwanted tags.  </p>
