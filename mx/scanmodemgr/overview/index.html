        <p>The ScanModeMgr is used to adjust a TC55 device for left-handed or right-handed operation by swapping the Power key and Scan trigger on a device, or by configuring both side buttons as Scan triggers. </p>

<p>The power and scanner buttons are on opposing sides of the TC55, which can sometimes lead to incorrect presses. To adjust the device for optimum productivity, the ScanModeMgr can reverse the Power and Scan-trigger functions, or set both side buttons as Scan-triggers and move the Power function to the front.</p>
