        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Card Emulation (CE) mode. When enabled, the device behaves like a contactless smart card and can be used in place of credit/debit card, transit card, access card, etc. When CE is enabled, the device does not generate its own RF field but relies on the NFC reader to do so. </p>
