NFC-A
The signalling type NFC-A is based on ISO/IEC 14443A. It is similar to RFID type A. In the type-A based communication delay encoding (miller encoding) technique is employed along with AM modulation. Here binary data is transmitted with the data rate of about 106 Kbps using type A communication. Here binary signal must change from 0 % to 100 % to distinguish between binary 1 and binary 0 data informations.
