        <p>This parm allows you to specify the Alias to be used to identify a Certificate. When installing a Certificate, the specified Alias is associated with the Certificate (and the corresponding Private Key for a Client Certificate). If a Certificate with the same Alias is already present, it will be replaced. When uninstalling a Certificate, the Alias associated with a previously installed Certificate should be specified. If a match is found, the matching Certificate will be removed. If an attempt is made to uninstall a Certificate for which no match is found, then an error will be returned in the Result XML.</p>
