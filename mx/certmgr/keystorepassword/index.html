        <p>Used to enter the password that will be used to Initialize the Android Keystore. Entering an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause a random password to be generated to Initialize the Android Keystore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This password will never need to be supplied again to the CertMgr once the Android Keystore has been successfully initialized since it will be able Install and Uninstall Certificates without needing this password. But the device user might need to know this password to perform management of Certificates using the System Settings Menu. If the password is lost or if a random password is generated, then the device user could not be supplied with the password and hence could never perform such management. This is generally not a problem since management of Certificates is generally a feature best left to MDMs and it is better to prevent the device user from performing such functions.</p>
