        <p>Used to Install or Uninstall a certificate or to initialize the Android Keystore. If a certificate is installed with the same alias as one that already exists in the Keystore, the existing certificate is overwritten by the new one.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Android Keystore can be "initialized" only once</strong>; subsequent uses of the Initialize Android Keystore function will simply reset the password, leaving the Keystore intact. To return the Android Keystore to a pre-initialized state, see the Enterprise Reset and Factory Reset functions of <a href="/mx/powermgr">Power Manager</a>.</li>

<li><strong>To verify certificate installation on the device</strong>: 


<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings -&gt; Wifi -&gt; AddNetwork</strong></li>

<li>From Security drop-down, <strong>select "802.1xEAP"</strong> </li>

<li>From EAP method drop-down, <strong>select "TLS" menu</strong> </li>

<li><strong>Installed certificate appears under "User certificate"</strong></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
