        <p>Controls whether the device will be permitted to pair with remote Bluetooth devices without requiring user confirmation. This feature is not the same as auto-pairing; it simply removes the confirmation step after device pairing has been initiated by the device user. The settings of this parameter do not effect existing device pairings.</p>

<p>By default, Silent Pairing Rules are in place to allow some Zebra device models to pair without user confirmation (after pairing is initiated by the user). <strong>Note</strong>: Default pairing rules for the devices listed below match by device Name only. For improved security, <strong><u>Zebra recommends that default rules be replaced</u> with rules matching by device Name, Upper Address Part and/or, if supported, Remote Device PIN and/or Remote Device MAC</strong>.</p>
