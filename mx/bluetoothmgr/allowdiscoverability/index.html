        <p>Controls whether the device can be put into "discoverable" mode by the device user. When in this mode, the device can <strong><em>be discovered</em></strong> by other Bluetooth devices, which could then attempt to pair with it. This parameter has no effect on the device's own ability to discover other devices, to initiate pairing requests with them, or to reconnect with devices it had paired with previously. </p>
