        <p>The Bluetooth Manager (BluetoothMgr) controls whether a device can pair with Bluetooth peripherals such as headsets, printers and scanners that come into range, and whether the device can be "discoverable," which would enable other Bluetooth devices to initiate pairing requests with it. </p>

<p>Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band that was originally intended as a replacement for serial communications cables. It has since been adopted as a standard for hands-free headsets, stereo audio, networking to PCs and connections for barcode scanners, medical equipment and other devices formerly using RS-232. </p>

<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT</u>:</strong> For <a href="/licensing/about/#professional">Zebra Professional-series devices</a>, the following Bluetooth Manager parameters require purchase of a Mobility DNA Enterprise License: </p>

<p>Zebra devices running Android 8.x Oreo and later come with the Zebra Bluetooth Settings (ZBS) app preinstalled. When run on a device with Bluetooth enabled, this app scans discoverable devices in the vicinity and displays their Bluetooth name, MAC address and Upper Address Part (UAP) information similar to the image shown below.  </p>

<h5 id="toexposebluetoothinfoofnearbydevices" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#toexposebluetoothinfoofnearbydevices"><span></span></a>To expose Bluetooth info of nearby devices:</h5>

<ol>
<li>Set the relevant device(s) as discoverable.</li>

<li>Open the Zebra Bluetooth Settings app on a device. </li>

<h3 id="nfctaptopair" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#nfctaptopair"><span></span></a>NFC Tap-to-Pair</h3>

<p><strong>All Zebra MDNA-licensed mobile computers support the NFC Tap-to-Pair feature without further configuration</strong>. This allows automatic "out-of-the-box" pairing with the supported Zebra peripherals listed below. An MDNA Enterprise license is included with all Zebra mobile computers <em>except</em> the <a href="/licensing/about/#zebraprofessionalseriesdevices">Professional series</a>, for which a license must be purchased to enable the feature. </p>

<p><strong><a href="/licensing">Learn more about Zebra device licensing</a></strong>. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DS30</strong> DEX device </li>

<li><strong>HS3100</strong> rugged Bluetooth headset </li>

<li><strong>RS6100</strong>, <strong>RS6000</strong> and <strong>RS5100</strong> ring scanners</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="performingnfctaptopair" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#performingnfctaptopair"><span></span></a>Performing NFC Tap-to-Pair</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Confirm that NFC is enabled</strong> on the mobile computer and peripheral to be paired, and that neither device is in a suspended state. </li>

<li><strong>Locate the NFC sensor locations on each device and tap them together</strong> until a tone is heard. </li>

<li><strong>On licensed devices</strong>, a confirmation message is displayed on the mobile computer to indicate successful pairing.<br>
<strong>On unlicensed devices</strong>, the Bluetooth settings panel appears to allow manual pairing. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#notes"><span></span></a>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>The NFC Tap-to-Pair feature is always enabled; it cannot be disabled or otherwise configured. </li>

<li>If attempting to pair a peripheral to a mobile computer already connected to another device, the previously paired device is unpaired and the new peripheral is paired and connected.</li>

<li>Feature NOT supported on some non-GMS devices when in SSI* or SPP* modes. </li>
</ul>

<p><i><font size="2" color="DimGrey"> * SSI = synchronous serial interface; SPP = serial port profile  </font></i></p>
