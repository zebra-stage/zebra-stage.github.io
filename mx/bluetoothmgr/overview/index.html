        <p>The Bluetooth Manager (BluetoothMgr) controls whether a device can pair with Bluetooth peripherals such as headsets, printers and scanners that come into range, and whether the device can be "discoverable," which would enable other Bluetooth devices to initiate pairing requests with it. </p>

<p>Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band that was originally intended as a replacement for serial communications cables. It has since been adopted as a standard for hands-free headsets, stereo audio, networking to PCs and connections for barcode scanners, medical equipment and other devices formerly using RS-232. </p>

<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT</u>:</strong> For <a href="/licensing/about/#professional">Zebra Professional-series devices</a>, the following Bluetooth Manager parameters require purchase of a Mobility DNA Enterprise License: </p>

<p>Zebra devices running Android 8.x Oreo and later come with the Zebra Bluetooth Settings (ZBS) app preinstalled. When run on a device with Bluetooth enabled, this app scans discoverable devices in the vicinity and displays their Bluetooth name, MAC address and Upper Address Part (UAP) information similar to the image shown below.  </p>
