        <p>Used to enter the name of a Bluetooth device with which to allow device pairing without requiring user confirmation. <strong>On devices running Android 9.2 (and older), only the Name field is required to create a Silent Pairing Rule</strong> but can be combined with other fields (e.g. Class of Device and/or Upper Address Part) to improve security. </p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>On devices with MX 9.3 and later, the Name <u>MUST</u> be combined with the Upper Address Part (UAP) of the device's MAC address to create Silent Pairing Rules</strong>. This change was implemented for compliance with a Google security mandate. </p>

<p><strong>Input value rules</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>String from 1-255 characters containing Bluetooth device name. For example: "Zebra Printer_01" </li>
