        <p>Used to choose whether to Add a Named Key to the Key Storage Database on the device. Adding a Named Key to the Key Storage Database on the device makes a key available for use when activating Full Storage Card Encryption or when creating EFSes.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Only one Encrypted File System (EFS) can be mounted at a time using a given mount point. </li>

<li>Attempts to create an EFS with a mount point that is already in use by a mounted EFS will result in creation of a new EFS that will not be mounted. </li>

<li>Named keys added to the Key Storage Database can impact storage cards or EFSes previously encrypted using that key. </li>

<li>Storage that became inaccessible by removing its key will become accessibe and could be re-mounted when a key of the same name and value is added. </li>
</ul>
