        <p>Used to enter the Key Value to be associated with a Named Key being added to the Key Storage Database. Entering an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause a random key value to be automatically generated and used on the device. <strong>Read important notes below regarding random key generation</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: Random, machine-generated keys are generally considered the most secure. Such keys are virtually impossible to guess because of their length, and cannot be accidentally revealed because they are never known to the user. <strong>However, if a random key is lost, data encrypted using that key is also lost</strong>. Persistent data could be rendered irretrievable on a device following an Enterprise Reset or other erasure event if the only copy of the encryption key is erased during that event. The Install Key Value parameter accepts 256-bit AES encryption values generated using any desired mechanism. Once generated, Key Values should be managed and preserved carefully.</p>
