        <p>Used to activate or deactivate Full Storage Card Encryption. An attempt to activate or deactivate Full Storage Card Encryption may fail for various reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Storage Card is removable and is not currently present in the device</li>

<li>The Storage Card is not currently mounted or is inaccessible</li>

<li>The specified Named Key is not present in the Key Storage Database.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever Full Storage Card Encryption is activated or deactivated, the Storage Card must be reformatted as encrypted or unencrypted, respectively. Reformatting causes the loss of all data on the card. If there is data that must be preserved, it would have to be copied to another location before activating or deactivating encryption and then copied back after the card is reformatted.</p>
