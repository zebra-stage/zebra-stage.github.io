<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The process of Creating an Encrypted File System (EFS) takes time since it must create the Backing Storage File (BSF) and mount the EFS on its designated Mount Point. As a result, applications will not be able to access an EFS via its Mount Point until it is successfully mounted. Further, an EFS could later be un-mounted if the Key Name it is using is Removed from the Key Storage Database. Applications that use an EFS should thus include error handling logic that can deal with situations where the EFS is not mounted and cannot be accessed.</p>

<p>An attempt to Create an Encrypted File System creation may fail for various reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>A BSF with the specified EFS name already exists in the specified storage location. Only one EFS of a given name can be created for each storage location.</li>

<li>The storage location specified for the BSF is not accessible (e.g. is not mounted) or is not writable.</li>

<li>The storage location specified for the BSF has insufficient free space to create the BSF of the specified size.</li>

<li>The storage location specified for the BSF is a Storage Card for which Full Storage Card Encryption has been activated.</li>

<li>The Named Key specified for the EFS is not present in the Key Storage Database.</li>

<li>The size specified for the EFS is invalid.</li>
</ul>
