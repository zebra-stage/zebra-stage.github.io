        <p>The Encrypt Manager (EncryptMgr) allows apps to manage the Key Storage Database, activate or deactivate Full Storage Card Encryption, and create or delete Encrypted File Systems (EFSes).
To configure encryption, certain questions must be answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>What data will be encrypted?</li>

<li>Where will the encrypted version of the data be physically stored?</li>

<li>How will the unencrypted version of the data be accessed by applications?</li>

<li>Which keys will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data?</li>
</ul>

<p>Zebra Android devices support encrypting data that is stored in the device file system using two modes of operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full Storage Card Encryption Mode allows a single Storage Card, usually the one that is physically removable (e.g. a Micro SD Card) to be formatted as one single encrypted file system. This mode is particularly useful, from a security point of view, because it protects all data stored on the Storage Card from being accessed externally if the card is physically removed from the device. In this mode, the entire card is encrypted, and the key used to perform the encryption is not stored on the card. Since data is encrypted and decrypted transparently, applications running on the device can access all the data on the Storage Card as if it were not encrypted. Applications access an encrypted Storage Card using the same paths they would use if the Storage Card was not encrypted. </li>
</ul>

<p>Different kinds of devices can respond differently when "Full Storage Card Encryption Mode" is turned on, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a device (such as the MC40) does not have a removable Storage Card, then the built-in Primary External Storage volume will be encrypted in the same way that a removable Storage Card would be encrypted.</li>

<li>If the device does support a removable Storage Card and the slot for it is empty, MXMS will return an error indicating that no card was found and the built-in Primary External Storage will not be encrypted.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If "Full Storage Card Encryption Mode" is turned on while a removable Storage Card is in the slot, the removable Storage Card will be encrypted. It will remain encrypted after being removed from the device and will mountable only in the device that originally encrypted it, provided its key is present. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing a Storage Card from unencrypted to encrypted or encrypted to unencrypted requires reformatting the card, which erases all data on the card. If there is data that must be preserved, it must be copied to another location before activating or deactivating encryption and copied back after the card is reformatted.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Folder Encryption Mode allows any number of Encrypted File Systems (EFS) to be created. The data for each EFS resides in a single file that must be stored on some non-encrypted file system. This file is called the Backing Storage File (BSF). A BSF can be located on internal storage (e.g. /data) or on the Primary Storage Card. The BSF is named based on the name of the EFS. An EFS is mounted at a virtual path, called its Mount Point. The Mount Point for an EFS could enter a path on the same non-encrypted file system where the BSF is located or could enter a path on a different file system. Since data is encrypted and decrypted transparently, applications running on the device can access all the data on an EFS as if it was not encrypted. Applications must access an EFS using the Mount Point path that is established when the EFS is created.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> While the BSF for an EFS can be stored on a Storage Card that is removable, it cannot be stored on a Storage Card that is encrypted using Full Storage Card Encryption Mode. If an attempt is made to create an EFS, whose BSF is on a Storage Card that is encrypted using Full Storage Card Encryption, then an error will be returned in the Result XML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zebra Android devices have a Key Storage Database of named encryption keys. Each Named Key has an associated Key Value that can be used to encrypt a Full Storage Card and/or to encrypt any number of EFSes. When activating Full Storage Card Encryption or creating an EFS, a Named Key must be specified and must exist in the Key Storage Database. If a Named Key is removed from the Key Storage Database, Full Storage Card Encryption and/or EFSes that are encrypted using that Named Key will become inaccessible. Adding the Named Key (with the same Key Value) will restore accessibility.</p>
