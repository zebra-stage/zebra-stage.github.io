        <p>Controls whether a beacon is transmitted by a device when powered OFF while in Airplane Mode. <strong>Disabled by default</strong>. Airplane Mode can be administered on the device using <a href="/mx/settingsmgr">Settings Manager</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT</u></strong>: When a device is placed in Airplane Mode, all device radios are switched off, including the device's beacon emitter. If a device is powered off while in Airplane Mode, the setting contained in the <strong>Beaconing in Airplane Mode</strong> parameter comes into play. </p>

<p><strong>Device behavior for this mode is as follows</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>If "Turn On" is selected</strong>, a beacon is emitted if the device is turned off while in Airplane Mode until the device battery runs out or the device is powered on again. <strong><u>This setting allows BLE radio transmissions from a powered-off device</u>, which could be undesired in some situations</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>If "Turn Off" is selected</strong>, no beacon is emitted when the device is turned off while in Airplane Mode.<br><strong>In this scenario, <u>the beacon would be unavailable to help locate a powered-off device</u></strong>. </p></li>
</ul>
