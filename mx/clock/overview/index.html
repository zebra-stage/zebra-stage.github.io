        <p>Clock allows an administrator to manually set the Date, Time and Time Zone on a device, configure the device to automatically acquire those settings from an NTP server, and to choose between 12-hour and 24-hour "military time" display formats.</p>

<p>Zebra Android devices track the current Date and Time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) standard. That information enables the Clock to accurately calculate the local Date and Time, expressed as the Local Time Coordinate (LTC). UTC is the equivalent of LTC at the Prime Meridian in Greenwich, England, where no offsets apply. For most other places, LTC is calculated starting with the UTC and adding or subtracting time based on the Time Zone in which the device being used, plus or minus the Daylight Saving Time offset, if any.</p>

<p><strong>Date and Time values given to the Clock must be represented as UTC</strong>. This ensures an accurate result when calculating the Date and Time based on Time Zone and Daylight Saving Time offsets. If LTC were used as a starting point, the order in which the Date, Time, and Time Zone were set could effect the resulting values. For example, combinations such as the times "skipped" during adjustment for Daylight Saving Time would become invalid if starting out with LTC values. For more information, please <strong>refer to UTC-LTC Conversion Examples</strong> at the end of this guide.</p>
