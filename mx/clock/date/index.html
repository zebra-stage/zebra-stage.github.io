        <p>This parm allows you to set the Date on the device. The Date must be specified in UTC and not in LTC. This means that the Date specified in UTC might be the same as the Date in LTC or might be one day earlier or later, depending on any offsets applied due to Time Zone and/or Daylight Saving Time. Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the current Date on the device to be left unchanged.</p>

<p>Parm value input rules: </p>

<ul>
<li>String with a size of exactly 0 or 10 characters</li>

<li>If non-empty, the string must be in the format of "yyyy-MM-dd" (e.g. "2013-12-31" would set the Date to UTC December 31, 2013".</li>
</ul>
