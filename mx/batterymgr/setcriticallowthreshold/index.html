        <p>Used to set a battery-charge percentage below which the charge level is considered critically low. This allows control over how long a device runs before being forced to shut down due to a low battery condition. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>A value of "-1" is supported only on devices with MX 13.4 or later</strong>; such devices can accept "0" as a critically low threshold value. On MX 13.3 (and earlier), "1" (one percent) is the smallest effective value supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Parm value input rules</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Integer from "-1"â€“25 (as a percentage of battery charge)</li>

<li><strong>MX 13.4 or later</strong>: a setting of "-1" causes no change to the prior device setting (if any)</li>

<li><strong>MX 13.3 or earlier</strong>: a setting of "0" causes no change to the prior device setting (if any)</li>
</ul>
