        <p>The Battery Manager (BatteryMgr) allows configuration of the battery-charge indicator LED, low-battery prompts, thresholds used to determine when a battery should be decommissioned and other battery-related settings.</p>

<h3 id="mainfunctionality" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#mainfunctionality"><span></span></a>Main Functionality</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enable/disable the battery-charge indicator LED</li>

<li>Enable/disable the battery swap user interface</li>

<li>Set the Battery Usage Decommission Threshold for PowerPrecision (formerly known as "Smart") batteries</li>

<li>Set the Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold for PowerPrecision+ (formerly known as "Gifted") batteries</li>

<li>Set the threshold for critically low charge </li>

<li>Set charging mode to optimize for device runtime or overall battery life (MC20 and similar devices only)</li>

<li>Schedule charging day(s) and time(s) to optimize battery life and device readiness for usage </li>

<li>Put a device in Shelf Mode, which reduces power consumption for storage or extended periods of inactivity</li>
</ul>

<p>Zebra Android devices support three battery classes: Regular, PowerPrecision (PP) and PowerPrecision+ (PP+). Regular batteries provide information only about battery charge level. PowerPrecision batteries add the ability to uniquely identify each battery and track its origin and usage history. PowerPrecision+ batteries add to PowerPrecision features the ability to provide detailed charge monitoring and health information and more accurate "gas gauging" data.</p>

<p>A key feature of PowerPrecision and PowerPrecision+ batteries is the ability to determine when a battery is nearing the end of its useful life and should to be taken out of service. For PowerPrecision batteries, decommissioning is based strictly on the battery's charge history. For PowerPrecision+, decommissioning decisions can be based on richer information about a battery's condition. In either case, the determination of when a battery should be decommissioned is configurable to account for the demands placed on batteries in different environments.</p>

<p>BatteryMgr allows configuration of the thresholds used to determine when a battery should be decommissioned. Once configured, these values (along with other battery parameters) are used by battery management software to determine the value of the decommission flag stored in a PowerPrecision or PowerPrecision+ battery and carried with it thereafter.</p>

<p><strong>Supported thresholds</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battery Usage Decommission Threshold


<ul>
<li>A battery is considered to be "decommissioned" if the battery usage number is greater than or equal to Battery Usage Decommission Threshold.</li>

<li>Battery Usage Decommission Threshold is applicable for PowerPrecision batteries and those for TC50 and TC75 devices.</li>

<li><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> The battery usage number is AggregateCharge/RatedCapacity of the battery.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Percent Decommission Threshold


<ul>
<li>A battery is considered to be decommissioned if the Health percentage of the battery is less than or equal to Percent Decommission Threshold.</li>

<li>Percent Decommission Threshold is applicable for PowerPrecision+ batteries.</li>

<li><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> Health percentage is the ratio between the "present_capacity" of the battery and its "design_capacity" at a discharge rate equal to the "design_capacity."</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The threshold values configured using BatteryMgr are stored in <code>batteryusage_decommission_threshold</code> or <code>percent_decommission_threshold</code> files, which persist on the device following any subsequent reboot or Enterprise Reset. A Factory Reset erases all such user data. Attempts to set a decommission threshold on a battery other than PowerPrecision or PowerPrecision+ battery returns an error in the Result XML document.</p>
