        <p>Controls whether the battery is charged using Android-default settings or a schedule and maximum charge percent, which can help increase long-term battery health while ensuring that devices are fully charged on days and times when required for usage. The system default (option 1) uses full voltage and charges the battery to its full capacity to maximize device runtime while on battery power. <strong>This is the current method for most Zebra device chargers</strong> and the default setting for this parameter. </p>
