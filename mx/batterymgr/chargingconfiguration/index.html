        <p>Controls whether the battery is charged in Standard or Custom mode. Standard mode uses full voltage and charges the battery to its full capacity to maximize device runtime while on battery power. <strong>This is the current method for most Zebra device chargers</strong> and the default setting for this parameter. On devices that support it, Custom mode charges at a slightly reduced voltage to less than the battery's full capacity, which helps extend the usable life of the battery over time. </p>
