        <p>Used to set the Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold on devices that support PowerPrecision+ (formerly known as "Gifted") batteries. A PowerPrecision+ (PP+) battery is considered "ready to be decommissioned" if its Battery Health is less than the currently configured Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold. The typical default value for this parameter is 80 but may vary between different products or batteries. A value of 80 indicates that a PP+ battery should be decommissioned once its Actual Capacity is less than 80 percent of its original Rated Capacity. If the Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold is modified, the new value is stored on the device and will update on any batteries subsequently inserted in the configured device. This allows the battery to use the new value when charged outside of the configured device, such as in a battery charger.</p>

<p>PP+ batteries can determine their "Actual Capacity" under specific discharge conditions. Based on this, PP+ batteries can estimate their Battery Health as the percentage the Actual Capacity is of the "Rated Capacity." Over time, the Actual Capacity and the Battery Health will diminish, and it's reasonable to expect that a battery with a lower Battery Health has a shorter remaining useful lifetime than a device with greater Battery Health.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> This parameter can be used on Zebra Android devices that support PP+ batteries regardless of whether a PP+ battery is currently installed in the device. This allows administrators to configure the decommission threshold for devices currently using PowerPrecision (formerly known as "Smart") batteries in advance of installing PP+ ones. If this parameter is used on a device that does not support PP+ batteries, an error is returned in the Result XML document.</p>

Used to set the Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold on devices that support PowerPrecision+ (formerly known as "Gifted") batteries. A PowerPrecision+ (PP+) battery is considered "ready to be decommissioned" if its Battery Health is less than the currently configured Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold. The default value for this parameter is 75, indicating that a PP+ battery should be decommissioned once its Actual Capacity is less than 75 percent of its original Rated Capacity.
