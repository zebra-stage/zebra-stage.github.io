        <p>This parm allows you to set the Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold on devices that have support for Smart Batteries.</p>

<p>Smart Batteries accumulate the total amount of charge that is placed into the battery over time. This accumulation is referred to as Aggregated Charge. Over time, the Aggregated Charge will grow, and it is a reasonable expectation that a battery with a larger Aggregated Charge has a shorter remaining useful lifetime than a device with a smaller Aggregated Charge.</p>

<p>The Battery Number is determined by dividing the Aggregated Charge of a Smart Battery by its Rated Capacity. Battery Number is therefore an attempt to assess how much impact on the health of the battery has occurred as a result of the absolute amount of charging and discharging that battery has undergone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not possible to say with any certainty what the relative impact on battery health will be as a result of partial charge cycles vs. full charge cycles. Two batteries will have similar Battery Numbers if they have similar amounts of Aggregated Charge. But if those batteries had very different charging and discharging patterns, then comparing their Battery Numbers may not tell us anything useful about their relative health. One thing we can say with certainty is that the health of a given battery will reduce as its computed Battery Number battery increases. Nonetheless, it is likely reasonable to assume that batteries with very high Battery Numbers are "less healthy" than batteries with very low Battery Numbers. Therefore, by setting a threshold based on a very high Battery Number, it should be possible to identify batteries that are most likely to need replacement.</p>

<p>A Smart Battery is considered to be ready to be decommissioned if the Battery Usage Number is greater than or equal to the currently configured Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold. The default value for the Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold is 400, indicating that a Smart Battery should be decommissioned once it has undergone an approximate of 400 "full discharge/charge" cycles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This parm can be used on a Zebra Android device that has the ability to support Smart Batteries, whether or not a Smart Battery is currently present in the device. For example, a device could support both Regular and Smart Batteries. In such a case, this parm could be used to configure how the device will handle a Smart Battery in the future, should one be inserted, even if the device currently has a Regular Battery inserted. If this parm is on a device that does not support Smart Batteries, then an error will be returned in the Result XML document.</p>
