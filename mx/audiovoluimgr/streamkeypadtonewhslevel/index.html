        <p>Used to set the minimum, maximum, and preset volume levels for the audio stream used for keypad feedback when the device is in wired headset mode. <strong>Valid range for this stream is 0–4 (0=off; 4=max)</strong>, with values separated by commas. The device user cannot reduce or increase the volume outside of the set minimum/maximum range. Entering an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) causes no change to the volume levels.</p>
