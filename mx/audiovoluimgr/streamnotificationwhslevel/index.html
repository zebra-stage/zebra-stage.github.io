        <p>Used to set the minimum, maximum, and preset volume levels for the audio stream that is typically used for other notifications when the device is in wired headset mode. <strong>Valid range for this stream is 0–7 (0=inaudible; 7=max)</strong>. The user will not be able to lower or raise the volume outside of the minimum/maximum range that is set. If the notification volume level was outside of this range at the time that this range is set, then the volume of this stream will be equal to the minimum or maximum level depending on whether it was below or above this volume range.</p>

<p>The preset volume level is a third volume level that must be greater than or equal to the minimum volume level and less than or equal to the maximum volume level. If the preset volume is outside of the minimum/maximum range, this value will be equal to the minimum or maximum level depending on whether it was below or above this volume range. This will be used by the SetCurrentProfileOption feature to adjust the volume of the audio stream that is typically used for other notifications to this set level. </p>

<p>Entering an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to the volume levels.</p>

<p><strong>Parm value input rules</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>String that contains the minimum, maximum, and preset volumes in this order and separated by commas. For example, "1,5,3" sets a minimum of 1, a maximum of 5 and a preset of 3.</li>

<li>Positive integers from 0–7. 
<!-- 1/21/19- removed, per eng. * A setting of "256,256,256" is the equivalent of "0,[max],[median]" for the stream. --></li>
</ul>
