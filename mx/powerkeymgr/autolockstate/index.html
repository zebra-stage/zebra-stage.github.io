        <p>This is the On/Off switch for the Android Automatic Screen Lock feature, which can be used to force activation of the screen lock whenever the screen is shut off using the power key. When turned off, the lock screen does not appear when turning the screen on after using the power key to turn it off unless the <a href="/mx/devadmin">Screen-lock Timeout Interval</a> was exceeded. </p>
