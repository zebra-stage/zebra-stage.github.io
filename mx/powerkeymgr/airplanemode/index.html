When a device enters Airplane Mode, its Bluetooth, cellular and Wi-Fi radios are disabled; Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios can be turned back on if desired by the user. <strong>NOTE: Display of a disabled "Airplane Mode" control varies by device. On some devices the control is hidden, on others it's "grayed out," and on the MC18, MC40 and MC67 devices it appears normally but has no effect</strong>.</p>
