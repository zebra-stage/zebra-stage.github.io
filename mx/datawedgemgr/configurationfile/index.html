<li>For the best user experience, <strong>Zebra strongly recommends that device users be advised to <u>exit any DataWedge configuration UI screen</u></strong> before new Config files are remotely deployed.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends applying explicit file permissions to all <code>.db</code> files</strong> so that DataWedge file procedures are not impeded.</li>

2/27/25- Ian insists that we insert/re-insert (edited): 

Android 11 Notes: 
* **Files CANNOT be deployed via EMM to** `/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport` on the device or to removable device media. This is due to Android Scoped Storage restrictions.
* When deploying Datawedge DB files via EMM to /enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport (or any other folder under /enterprise), Zebra recommends using either the OEMConfig / Files option or OEMConfig / XML Passthrough. This ensures that files are copied with the correct file attributes, which might not be the case if using the file-sync feature of an EMM.


2/24/25- removed because it's apparently no longer true (per PO AA): 

* **<u>IMPORTANT ANDROID 11 NOTE</u>**: On devices running Android 11, **Zebra recommends avoiding the use of the** `/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport` **folder**; access to the `/enterprise` folder and its subfolders will be restricted on devices running Android 13 and later. 

7/19/21- the below was changed to the above, per eng.
**Zebra recommends copying any configuration files to the** `/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport` **folder *prior* to calling DataWedgeMgr** with the configuration file and path. When DataWedge launches, it checks this folder and executes the following functions if files are present:

1. Import the new file(s)
2. Replace the existing Config file and like-named Profile(s), if any
3. Delete the imported files
4. Put new settings immediately into effect

3/26/20- removed per eng: 
* **DataWedge versions prior to 6.9** attempt to consume any of the monitored “`.db`” files as soon the file name(s) appear in the `/autoimport` folder. Therefore, **it is possible for DataWedge to attempt to consume a file before it is completely written**. To avoid this condition, **Zebra recommends initially storing the file with an alternate extension** (i.e. "`.tmp`") and changing the extension to `.db` once writing is complete.

10/8/19- removed; this CSP requires Android 7.6 
* **On devices running Android KitKat or later**, the `/enterprise` folder cannot be seen with File Explorer or other user-level tools. Moving configuration files to and from the `/autoimport` or `/enterprisereset` folders must be done programmatically, or with a staging client app or EMM.
