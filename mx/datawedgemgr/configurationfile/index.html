<p><strong>Input value rules</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>String from 0–255 characters containing name of configuration file on the device</li>

<p>DataWedge supports the importation of Config files (<code>datawedge.db</code>) and Profiles (<code>dwprofile_profilename.db</code>) to devices delivered through commercially available Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) systems. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Zebra recommends using FileMgr to download or copy data configuration file(s) to the</strong> <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code> or <code>/storage/emulated/0/Download</code> folder prior to calling DataWedgeMgr.<br>
  <strong><u>IMPORTANT</u>: Turn off the Auto-importing option<u></u></strong> if file(s) are to be copied to <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code>. </p>

**Zebra recommends copying any configuration files to the** `/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport` **folder *prior* to calling DataWedgeMgr** with the configuration file and path. When DataWedge launches, it checks this folder and executes the following functions if files are present:

1. Import the new file(s)
2. Replace the existing Config file and like-named Profile(s), if any
3. Delete the imported files
4. Put new settings immediately into effect
-->

<p><strong><u>RECOMMENDATIONS</u></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the best user experience, <strong>Zebra strongly recommends that device users be advised to <u>exit any DataWedge configuration UI screen</u></strong> before new Config files are remotely deployed.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends applying explicit file permissions to all <code>.db</code> files</strong> so that DataWedge file procedures are not impeded.</li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends deleting DataWedge configuration files</strong> from the download location after completing the staging process.</li>

<li><strong><u>IMPORTANT ANDROID 11 NOTE</u></strong>: On devices running Android 11, <strong>Zebra recommends avoiding the use of the</strong> <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code> <strong>folder</strong>; access to the <code>/enterprise</code> folder and its subfolders will be restricted on devices running Android 13 and later. </li>
</ul>

* **On devices running Android KitKat or later**, the `/enterprise` folder cannot be seen with File Explorer or other user-level tools. Moving configuration files to and from the `/autoimport` or `/enterprisereset` folders must be done programmatically, or with a staging client app or EMM. 

3/26/20- removed per eng: 
* **DataWedge versions prior to 6.9** attempt to consume any of the monitored “`.db`” files as soon the file name(s) appear in the `/autoimport` folder. Therefore, **it is possible for DataWedge to attempt to consume a file before it is completely written**. To avoid this condition, **Zebra recommends initially storing the file with an alternate extension** (i.e. "`.tmp`") and changing the extension to `.db` once writing is complete.
