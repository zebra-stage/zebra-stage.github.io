        <p>This is the On/Off switch for automatic importation of DataWedge configuration files when they're pushed to the <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code> folder on the device. When enabled (option 1), settings contained in a Configuration file take effect as soon as the file is pushed to the device if DataWedge is running when the file is received. If DataWedge is not running when a config file is pushed, settings take effect the next time DataWedge is launched. </p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong><u>SECURITY WARNING</u></strong>: Automatic importation of configuration settings can cause unwanted changes to device settings that result from pushing an unauthorized file to the device. <strong>Select "Turn Off" (option 0) to prevent unauthorized changes to the DataWedge configuration from taking effect</strong>.</p>
