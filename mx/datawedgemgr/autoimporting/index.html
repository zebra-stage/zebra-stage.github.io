        <p>This is the On/Off switch for automatic importation of DataWedge configuration files when they're pushed to the <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code> folder on the device. When enabled (option 1), settings contained in a Configuration file take effect as soon as the file is pushed to the device if DataWedge is running when the file is received. If DataWedge is not running when a config file is pushed, settings take effect the next time DataWedge is launched. </p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong><u>SECURITY WARNING</u></strong>: Automatic importation of configuration settings can cause unwanted changes to device settings that result from pushing an unauthorized file to the device. <strong>Select "Turn Off" (option 0) to prevent unauthorized changes to the DataWedge configuration from taking effect</strong>.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>Android 11 Note</strong>: Due to Android Scoped Storage Restrictions, files <strong>CANNOT</strong> be deployed using an EMM system to the internal (<code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport</code>) folder or to removable device media.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color:#27AE60;"></i> <strong>Zebra recommends using</strong> <code>/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge</code> <strong>OR</strong><code>/data/tmp/public</code> device folders and updating deployment paths accordingly.</p>
