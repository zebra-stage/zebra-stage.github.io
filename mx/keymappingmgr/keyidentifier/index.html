Attempts to add an Override Mapping for a Key that is not present on a device will produce an error in the Result XML. For a list of supported Keys on a specific device, query* the KeyMappingMgr for Key Identifiers (see Queries, below) or refer to the device documentation. For known deviations from these standards, <strong>see the <a href="#standardsanddeviations">Standards and Deviations section</a></strong> of the Overview at the top of this page. </p>
