        <p>The LicenseMgr administers the set of Software Licenses present on a device, thereby allowing an app to control the usability of Software Components that require licensing.</p>

<p>Software Licensing is a mechanism supported by Zebra Android devices that allows select Software Components to require a suitable Software License to be present on a device in order for those Software Components to be useable on that device. If a Software Component does not require licensing, then the presence or absence of any Software Licenses will have no impact on that Software Component. If a Software Component requires licensing, then the absence of a suitable Software License on a device will limit the full functionality of that Software Component. If a Software Component requires licensing, then applying a suitable Software License to that device will make that Software Component usable on that device. Subsequently removing that Software License from that device will limit the full functionality of that Software Component.</p>

<p>Software Licenses are acquired from a Zebra Software License Server, are issued as Software License Files, and are associated to specific Software Components through the use of Licensed Feature Names. A given Software License File can be used only to enable use of its associated Licensed Feature Name. A given Software Component could have multiple capabilities, use of each of which could be controlled through separate Licensed Feature Names. Or, a given Software Component could have all of its capabilities controlled through a single Licensed Feature Name.</p>

<p>Software Licenses acquired from a Zebra Software License Server may be Individual Device Licenses, with each Software License File tied to a specific device serial number. In such cases, it is necessary to apply the right Software License File to each matching device. Software Licenses acquired from a Zebra Software License Server may also be Enterprise Licenses, issued to all devices owned by a customer instead of to specifically identified devices. In such cases, the same Software License File can be applied to each device owned by that customer.</p>
