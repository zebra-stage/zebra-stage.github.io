<p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: Currently, there exists a single defined Standard Licensed Feature Name, that of the SimulScan OCR/OMR feature. Selecting it avoids the need to enter the exact (custom) value of the Licensed Feature Name. To verify other features, use the "Verify Custom Name" and enter the Licensed Feature Name to match the Software License File being used.</p>
