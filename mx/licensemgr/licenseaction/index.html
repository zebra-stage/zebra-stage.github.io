        <p>Used to apply or remove a Software License on a legacy Symbol device. <strong>For Zebra-branded devices, use the License Action Zebra parameter</strong>. </p>

<p>Applying a Software License on a device makes the specific capabilities of that Software Component usable on that device. Removing a license makes the controlled capability unusable or limits its features. <strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: The license removal action deletes the licence <strong>only from the private license <u>store</u></strong>; the license <em>file</em> still exists on the device and must be deleted separately.</p>
