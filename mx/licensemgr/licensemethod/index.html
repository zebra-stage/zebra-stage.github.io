<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of the method used to supply the Software License File (Embed or Reference), the supplied Software License File must contain valid contents that were acquired from the Zebra Software License Server. An attempt to apply a Software License File that contains invalid contents will result in an error in the Result XML. In addition, if the Software License File was an Individual Device License, then the device serial number embedded in the Software License File must match the serial number of the device onto which it is being applied. An attempt to apply a Software License File that contains an Individual Device License whose serial number does not match the serial number of the device to which it is being applied will result in an error in the Result XML</p>
