        <p>Controls whether to verify that the Licensed Feature Name specified in the Standard or Custom Feature Name parameters matches the contents of the Software License File. <strong>Zebra recommends using this parameter to help prevent license-feature mismatch</strong>.</p>

<p>Software License Files are acquired from the Zebra Software License Server, stored locally or online and referenced through the LicenseMgr. The sever does not verify whether such files are matched to a particular Licensed Feature. If a valid Software License File is wrongly applied to Licensed Feature other than the intended one, the feature will not be enabled and no error will result. The Verification Method parameter prevents this scenario by verifying that Licensed Feature Name(s) match those contained in the Software License File(s) and otherwise generates an error in the Result XML.</p>
