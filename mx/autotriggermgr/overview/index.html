        <p>The AutoTrigger Manager (AutoTriggerMgr) is used to configure automatic scan-triggering, which initiates scanning when a scan target is brought within proximity of the device sensor. Performing such functions would otherwise be manual. Automatic scanning is useful for such applications as those for supermarket self-service, in which a customer uses a hand-held device to scan items as they are placed in a shopping cart or basket. </p>
