        <p>Used to enter a friendly Device Name for a device. This allows a device to be more easily identified by apps, device users, administrators, etc. by referencing a name more meaningful than a serial number or other identifier. Optionally, the assigned Device Name can be combined with the device serial number if desired (see below). </p>
