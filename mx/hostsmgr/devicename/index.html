        <p>Used to enter a friendly Device Name for a device. This allows a device to be more easily identified by apps, device users, administrators, etc. by referencing a name more meaningful than a serial number or other identifier. Optionally, the assigned Device Name can be combined with the device serial number to provide a unique name for each device (see below). </p>

<p><strong>Input value rules</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accepts a string from 0 (no name assigned) to 255 alpha-numeric and/or special characters</li>

<li><strong>Spaces and ampersand (&amp;) character not supported</strong></li>

<li>Occurrences of the string <code>%serno%</code> within the entered string are replaced with the device serial number and included as part of the assigned Device Name</li>
</ul>
