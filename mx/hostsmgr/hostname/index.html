        <p>Used to assign a Host Name to a device, binding that name to the device IP address. The device can then be identified using its friendly name (i.e. “MyDevice”) by admins, applications and other devices on local and DNS-enabled IP networks. Once bound, the Host Name and IP address can be used interchangeably. A friendly name also can be registered with a DNS Server (if one is present on a given network) when the device joins that network, thereby allowing other stations on the network to more easily identify it and other devices present on the network.</p>
