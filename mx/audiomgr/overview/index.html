        <p>The Audio Manager (AudioMgr) controls a small number of specialized audio functions on Zebra devices, including whether audio on a device plays only through a connected headset or is replicated on the built-in device speaker (so that it plays on both). AudioMgr also controls whether a sound is played when the device is connected to a charger.  </p>

<p>The replication feature was developed for the VC80x vehicle-mount computer, which has a custom port for attaching the Zebra M1000 headset. AudioMgr can force audio normally sent only to the M1000 speaker to be replicated on the VC80x's built-in speaker. This addresses the issue of missed communications that can arise when the headset is not being worn. </p>
