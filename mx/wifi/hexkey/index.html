        <p>When Key Type is Hex Key, then a Key, which is expressed as a sequence of hexadecimal characters, needs to be specified. The type of Key required will vary based on the WPA Mode and Encryption Type specified, since it will need to be either a WEP 40 bit Key, a WEP 104 bit Key, or a 256 bit TKIP/AES-CCMP Key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, the parm value encryption process is not documented and the key that is needed to encrypt is not published. Therefore, an MDM cannot currently use encrypted Keys or Passphrases since there is no way to store an encrypted, server-supplied password in an XML.</p>
