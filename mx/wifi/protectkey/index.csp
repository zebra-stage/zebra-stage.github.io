Enables encryption of the Key. The Key (or the Passphrase used to generate a Key) is generally considered sensitive information since having the Key for a network grants access to that network. Since the Key or Passphrase must be embedded within the XML, it is often desirable to encrypt the Key or Passphrase so it cannot be extracted and exploited if the XML is intercepted. The specified WPA Mode and the Key Type determine what type of Key or Passphrase must used. The value selected for the ProtectKey parameter deterimes whether the Key or Passphrase will be specified as clear or encrypted text.
