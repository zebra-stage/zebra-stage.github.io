        <p>A Password is an authentication credential that is used to prove the authenticity of an Identity and therefore, is only used when the Security Mode is "Enterprise". All Authentication types require a Password except EAP-TLS, which uses a client certificate instead of a Password.</p>

<p>In most cases, it is important to protect a Password since, combined with the matching Identity, it can be used to authenticate and gain access to a network. Since the Password must be embedded within the XML, it is often desirable to encrypt the Password so that i cannot be extracted and exploited if the XML is intercepted. The ProtectPassword parm is used to indicate whether the Password will be specified in clear, unencrypted text or in encrypted form.</p>
