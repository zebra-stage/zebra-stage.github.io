<p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: The encryption process for this parameter value is currently undocumented, and the key required to encrypt is unpublished. Since there is currently no way to store an encrypted, server-supplied password within an XML file, mobile device management (MDM) systems cannot use an encrypted password. </p>
