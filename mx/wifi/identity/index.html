        <p>Identity is used only when Authentication is used, which also means that this is only used when the Security Mode is "Enterprise". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This parm is used by the device to specify to the Authentication Server the Identity that it wishes to authenticate as. The Identity is synonymous with "user name" in many cases. However, different Authentication Servers can be configured to require different types of Identity, such as email addresses, device unique ID, etc. </p>
  
  <p>The Identity is used as a way of getting accepted by the Authentication Server so that you can receive the encryption key that is needed to operate on the network. Once you are authenticated, the Identity does not have any further meaning and is not used to identify the device on the network.</p>
  
  <p>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Identity will not be set.</p>
