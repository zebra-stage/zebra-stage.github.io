        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Gratuitous ARP, which issues an address resolution protocol (ARP) announcement for updating the ARP tables of other hosts on the network. A recipient can use the ARP response frame received from a device to update its ARP cache or to add a new entry in the ARP table. </p>

<p>When this parameter is Enabled (option 1), a Zebra device transmits a Gratuitous ARP packet after every successful roam to a new access point. This can save the typical ARP request/response packets that the new AP might have to exchange with the device since the ARP table might already be updated.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>Attempts to use this parameter on a device that doesn't support it returns a value of "0" or "99" (depending on the MX version) in the relevant section of the Result XML file</strong>.</p>
