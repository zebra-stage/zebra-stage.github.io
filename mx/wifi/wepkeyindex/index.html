        <p>Some Wi-Fi infrastructure that implements a network using WEP encryption may support multiple WEP keys and a WEP index to indicate which key to use at any given time. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: Android does not currently support multiple WEP keys per network. Therefore, only the first WEP key (<code>wep[0]</code>) is supported.</p>
