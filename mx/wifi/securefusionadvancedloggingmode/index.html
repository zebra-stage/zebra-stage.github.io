        <p>HELP: 
Select whether to enable Secure Advanced Logging Mode, which encrypts Wi-Fi Advanced logs and imposes a user-specified password for log access.</p>

<p>OLD:
This is the On/Off switch for logging WLAN module events, which is sometimes helpful for troubleshooting. Logs from all Wi-Fi modules are stored in the <code>/fusionlogs</code> folder on the device. <strong>Caution</strong>: Logging might cause performance delays. </p>
