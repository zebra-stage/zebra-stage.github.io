        <p>Used to select whether to enable automatic Wi-Fi network selection when the device is in a connected state. When turned on, this allows the device to automatically switch to other networks based on signal quality or user preference.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong><u>ALERT</u></strong>: Some Wi-Fi parameters vary from conventions used by other CSPs: </p>

<ul>
<li>The "Enable" and "Disable" settings in Wi-Fi CSPs control whether a user or administrator can "turn on" and "turn off" a feature or capability, or to set its state as "active" or "inactive." Such terms in other CSPs refer to the feature's "Usage" setting, which can prevent access to the feature entirely.</li>

<li>The value "0" is sometimes used in Wi-Fi parameters to "Disable" a feature, select its default setting or "make no change" or "do nothing" to a setting. In most other CSPs, the "0" value is used to select the "make no change" option.  </li>
</ul>
