        <p>Used to control Radio Resource Management, a feature of the 802.11k specification that analyzes access point traffic and estimates the optimal connection for maximizing wireless communication throughput. When disabled (option 0), the device generally connects to the AP with the strongest signal. When enabled using "802.11k Lite" (option 1), the Wi-Fi client can request Neighbor Reports, from which compatible APs return a Beacon Table* containing information<i>†</i> about nearby APs to help manage network connections effectively while roaming. This can be especially useful for environments where multiple networks are present. </p>
