        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Radio Resource Management, a feature of the 802.11k specification that analyzes access point traffic and estimates the optimal connection for maximizing wireless communication throughput. When disabled (option 0), the device generally connects to the AP with the strongest signal. <strong>When enabled using "802.11k Lite" (option 1), the Wi-Fi client can request Neighbor Reports, from which compatible APs return information about nearby APs that offer optimal connections for client attachment while roaming</strong>. </p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>Attempts to use this parameter on a device that doesn't support it returns a value of "0" or "99" (depending on the MX version) in the relevant section of the Result XML file</strong>.</p>
