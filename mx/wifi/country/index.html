        <p>Used to select country-specific Wi-Fi regulatory settings. Choosing "AUTO" enables selection through 802.11d, which configures the device to listen for a country-specific beacon. Using the AUTO setting, the device will not transmit unless it can successfully detect the country and use a frequency that is consistent with the country's Wi-Fi infrastructure. This setting is the least likely to violate country-specific regulations. Countries that do not support the 802.11d infrastructure must be selected manually. </p>
