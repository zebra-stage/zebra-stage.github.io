When the selected Security Mode is "Personal" or "Enterprise," the WPA Mode must be specified to determine the key type to use. WPA performs encryption using the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol. A TKIP-compatible key must be specified. WPA2 supports encryption using TKIP (and is therefore backward-compatibile with WPA) and the more secure Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. For key selection for this mode, specify either TKIP, AES or auto-select. 

> **Note:** WEP is not supported with Enterprise Security Mode.
