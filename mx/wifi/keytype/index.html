        <p>Used to enter the type of encryption key to be used by the network. A key is specified only when the Security Mode is "Personal" since the "Open" Security Mode does not use encryption and the "Enterprise" Security Mode distributes keys automatically after Authentication.</p>

<p>An encryption key can be specified using either of these methods: </p>

<ul>
<li>A hexadecimal value (the key itself)</li>

<li>A passphrase used to generate a key using a pre-defined algorithm</li>
</ul>

<p>The selected method usually depends on the configuration of the Wi-Fi network because the key must be shared between the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the client. Therefore, they must use a common method to enter the key.</p>
