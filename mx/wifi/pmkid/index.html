        <p>Used to enable/disable Pairwise Master Key ID (PMKID) caching. A PMK is defined in the 802.11i specification as a key resulting from successful authentication between a wireless device and an access point. </p>

<p><strong><u>IMPORTANT</u>: Wi-Fi Advanced Options should be used only at the direction of Zebra Support or other qualified personnel. Altering this setting can result in undesirable behavior</strong>.</p>

<!-- paraphrased from the web: When receiving a subsequent authentication request with a PMKID, associated APs can respond more quickly. If PMKID is enabled, **OKC must be disabled for PMKID caching to operate**.-->
