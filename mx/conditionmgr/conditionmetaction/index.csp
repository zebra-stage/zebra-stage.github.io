Used to select the action to perform when the tested condition is not met. **To avoid moot conditions, Zebra recommends that the selected action be opposite of that selected in the "Condition Not Met Action" parameter**. For example, if "Success" is selected as the "Condition Met Action," the "Condition Not Met Action" should be one of the two remaining "Fail" options.
