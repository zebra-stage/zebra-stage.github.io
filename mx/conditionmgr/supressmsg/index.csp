Used to disable the display of error messages when ConditionMgr is used to control the flow of execution rather than detect failures. This allows administrators to designate certain errors generated by ConditionMgr not to be treated and displayed as errors to a device user.

For example, a device-staging process might contain conditions that cause different actions to be performed on different devices. Since "errors" generated by ConditionMgr in such cases do not indicate “failure” but are expected as part of the flow of execution for identifying such devices, displaying “Staging Failed” messages to the device user is undesirable because there was no failure in the staging process.
