        <p>Used to enter whether the tested value on the device is Boolean, Integer or String. Regardless of the data type selected, all condition tests must ultimately yield a Boolean (true/false) value. The Boolean Data Type, such as whether a device has a valid IP address, provides a direct result and therefore requires no further adjustment. To arrive at a Boolean value when testing Integers and Strings, one of the relevant condition tests (such as "greater-than" for numeric values or "contains" for a string) must be specified. For example, the test of whether a device is an MC40 would look for a string in the Device Model field that contains the constant "MC40" and if so, return a "true" result. <strong>Note: The Source Types and System Values presented will vary depending on the selected Data Type</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Important: There is currently no supported method of performing an ordered comparison</strong> (i.e. greater-than/less-than) on String values. This would become relevant, for example, when attempting to create flow-control rules based on the version of OSx on a device, which is a numeric value stored as a string. </p>

<p>While it might seem natural to attempt an operation on "all devices on which the OSx value is greater-than-or-equal-to 3.4," for example, this is not a supported action and could produce unwanted results. Although it's technically possible to treat a String as a floating point value, this too would be unpredictable due to variations in OSx version levels (i.e. 3.4.1.0) and other comparison factors. </p>
