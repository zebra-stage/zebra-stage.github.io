Used to select a comparator for a specified string against which to test constant string to arrive at a Boolean value. For example, to set an operation to proceed only on FIPS-based devices, set this value to 9 ("Starts-with a Constant String"), set the Constant String Value to FIPS and uncheck the "String Ignore Case" checkbox.
