<p><strong><code>IMPORTANT:</code> If GMS apps were previously disabled using the "DisableGMSApps" App Manager Action, they must be re-enabled using the "EnableGMSApps" App Manager Action <u>prior to upgrading the device for the purpose of enabling GMS Manager</u></strong>. Failure to do so can result in unpredictable behavior. <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is NOT possible to transition a device to a new OS <em><u>and</u></em> to implement GMS Restricted mode with a single XML profile.</p>
