        <p>GMS Manager (GmsMgr) controls which Google Mobile Services (GMS) are available on a Zebra device, giving device administrators improved control over data privacy and the flow of device information to third parties. </p>

<p>A device in "GMS "Restricted" mode disables many primary GMS applications and services, including (but not limited to): </p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome </li>

<li>Gmail</li>

<li>Google Play </li>

<li>Photos</li>

<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>

<p>This also renders inoperable secondary applications and services that rely on those primary services, including: </p>

<ul>
<li>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</li>

<li>Google Maps </li>

<li>Location services</li>

<li>SafetyNet</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Zebra recommends testing devices thoroughly before deployment when using this feature</strong>. </p>

<h4 id="importantnotes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#importantnotes"><span></span></a>Important Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Based on GMS dependencies, apps and services other than those listed above also might fail when a device is in GMS Restricted mode. </li>

<li>Apps that use FCM to deliver notifications are unable to do so using this framework when running on a GMS-restricted device. Such apps might fail or behave unpredictably. </li>

<li>When location services are disabled, the device is set to “Device Only” location mode.</li>

<li>The ability to add or manage users on a device is prevented by GMS Restricted; any existing Google accounts are disabled. </li>

<li><strong><u>GMS Manager is supported only on SDM660-platform devices</u>, which includes (but is not limited to)</strong>:


<ul>
<li>PS20</li>

<li>TC52</li>

<li>TC57</li>

<li>TC72</li>

<li>TC77</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Attempts to use GMS Manager on an unsupported device returns "Not Supported" in the relevant Result XML file.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mainfunctionality" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#mainfunctionality"><span></span></a>Main Functionality</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allow all GMS apps and services to run on the device</li>

<li>Enable a fixed, minimal set of GMS apps and services to run on the device</li>

<li>Enable only Google Chrome, Maps or the Firebase Cloud Messaging Service to run on the device </li>
</ul>
