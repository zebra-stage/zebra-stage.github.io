<li><code>Upon configuring Display Size (USING THIS PARAMETER??), the setting applies to device and when (AT THE TIME IT IS) docked on cradle ???, the same setting will be applied to external monitor ???</code> .</li>

<li>When the device is removed from cradle, Display Size will <code>restore to the option configured WHICH OPTION CONFIGURED WHERE-WHEN ???</code>.</li>

<li>If configuration is applied when device is in cradle and connected to External Monitor, Display Size is changed immediately on both device and monitor.</li>

<li>If configuration is applied and External Screen Resolution is changed manually via Settings UI, the configured display size will be overridden by the display size based on selected external screen resolution <code>do you mean that settings made here are overridden by those made in Settings UI?</code></li>

<li>When display size is selected manually <code>thru settings UI?</code>, it is applied on device. On docking device to cradle, previously configured display size by admin will be applied on external monitor <code>and device stays the same as set manually?</code>.</li>

<li>If display size is selected manually when device is in cradle, it will be applied on device and monitor. On device undock, display size will restore to the setting previously configured by admin.</li>

<li>If the configured display size is not supported for that respective external screen resolution, then it would be treated as custom value and the display size <code>seek bar???</code> will set to LARGEST on external monitor. But the actual display size of the view would be set to the configured value.</li>
