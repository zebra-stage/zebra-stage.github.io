<li>If a configuration is applied when a device is in a cradle and connected to an external monitor, the Display Size is changed immediately on the device and the monitor.</li>

<li>If a configured Display Size is not supported for the resolution setting of the external monitor, the "LARGEST" Display Size is used, but the configured value is retained internally and considered a custom value.</li>
