        <p>Controls the on-screen Lock Override button, which (when enabled) allows the device user to override the screen orientation locked by the administrator or an app. </p>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: When "AutoRotate" is turned off on the device, a "change orientation" button appears briefly whenever the device orientation is changed, allowing the device user to manually override any forced screen orientation. Setting this parameter to "Disable" (option 2) hides that button, removing the ability to override the admin-set screen orientation.</p>
