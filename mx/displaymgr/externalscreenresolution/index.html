        <p>Used to select screen resolution on the secondary (external) display when a device is connected to an external monitor through a workstation cradle.</p>

<!--
CONSIDER ADDING THE FOLLOWING

Pre-requisite: Enable Force Desktop Mode in Developer Options under Settings in device. Select Mirror Device Screen under Secondary Display Mode in StageNow DisplayMgr CSP and apply the configuration.
• By default, the value selected in External Screen Resolution list in OOB device is 1920x1200.
• If configuration is applied when device is in cradle and connected to External Monitor, the resolution is not applied to device and monitor unless Display Settings UI is opened, or device is undocked and docked again. Same behavior is observed when External Screen Resolution is set using adb commands. This behavior is controlled by Android.
• If configuration is applied when device is in cradle and connected to External Monitor, and if device is restarted immediately, resolution is not changed in Display Settings UI and not applied to device or monitor. Same behavior is observed when External Screen Resolution is set using adb commands. This behavior is controlled by Android.
• Upon configuring this setting, if font size or display size is changed, on removing device from cradle, font size remains same as the value selected before docking device to cradle. Display size falls back to default (medium) after removing device from cradle.
• When this setting is configured and device is placed in workstation cradle without external monitor connection, resolution is applied to the device, on undocking the device, resolution falls back to default.
• When this setting is configured, device resolution falls back to default only when device is removed from workstation cradle. If device is retained in workstation cradle and HDMI cable is removed (external monitor disconnected), configured resolution on the device does not fall back to default.
• This configuration has no effect when ZebraWorkstationConnect is installed, and desktop mode is configured.
• This setting is applied globally when device is in COPE mode.
