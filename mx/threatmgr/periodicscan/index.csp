This is the On/Off switch for Periodic Scans on the device, which detect apps with the "super-user" permissions and other characteristics generally associated with root-based malware. When Periodic Scan is disabled, Threat detection scanning occurs each time the device boots. When enabled, scans are performed according to the interval specified in the Periodic Scan Interval parameter. **Scan frequency can effect battery life**.
