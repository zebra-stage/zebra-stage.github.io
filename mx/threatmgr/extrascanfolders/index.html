        <p>This is the On/Off switch for folder monitoring. This Extra Scan Folders feature monitors one or more folders on the device (including those in Android-protected areas) as specified in the Extra Scan Folders List parameter. When a change within a monitored folder occurs, ThreatMgr broadcasts an Intent with the folder name and one of the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/FileObserver.html#constants">Android FileObserver constants</a> to describe the event. </p>

<p><em>This parameter does not detect Threats</em>*. </p>
