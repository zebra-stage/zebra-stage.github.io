        <p>Controls whether the DHCP client can send a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) value and optional flag to the DHCP server as a means of updating IP-address-to-FQDN mapping. </p>

<p>An FQDN is the complete domain name for a specific internet host computer, including its hostname and domain name. For example, the FQDN of Google's Gmail server "mail.google.com" includes the hostname "mail" and the domain name "google.com." The server's hostname distinguishes it from other servers in the Google.com domain, and its domain name sets Google's mail server apart from other public mail servers.</p>

<p>For complete information about FQDN options, please refer to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702">IETF's FQDN Option page</a>. </p>
