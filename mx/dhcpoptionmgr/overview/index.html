        <p>The DHCP Option Manager (DhcpOptionMgr) allows an app to configure options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on the device. This can simplify device administration by allowing network settings such as the device's IP address and default gateway to be configured automatically using DHCP protocols. </p>

<p>When using DHCP on a device, the DHCP Client sends a DHCP Request to a DHCP Server and receives back a DHCP Acknowledgment. A request can contain information about the device or the client, as well as requests for additional information from the server. The acknowledgment contains the IP address assigned to the device by the server along with any additional information requested by the device.</p>

<p>DHCP Options are variable-length strings identified by DHCP Option Numbers that can be included in the request or acknowledgment to convey information between a client and server. From the point of view of the device where the DHCP Client is running, a DHCP Option can support a mode of Write (if the DHCP Client sends the option to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request) or Read (if the DHCP Client receives information from the DHCP Server in the DHCP Acknowledgment). DHCP can support a wide variety of DHCP Options, including custom options that can be defined by equipment vendors or end customers.</p>
