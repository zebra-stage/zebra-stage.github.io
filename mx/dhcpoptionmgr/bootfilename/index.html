        <p>Controls whether a request for a Boot File name will be sent by the DHCPv4 Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the Boot File name to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.</p>

<p>A Boot File is a file that is typically used to configure a device when it first joins a network. A common usage scenario is to pull a Boot File of a given name from a TFTP Server and then use that Boot File to configure the device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: The DHCP Client does not automatically use the Boot File name to configure the device or perform file transfers. To configure a device, a Boot File name and a TFTP Server Name must both be acquired using the DhcpOptionMgr and provided to a TFTP Client that could perform the boot-file transfer. Once transferred, the file can then be consumed to perform any desired configuration.</p>
