        <p>Control whether a request for the Domain Search list will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the Domain Search list for the network to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system that associates domain names to the IP Addresses. When seeking to resolve a name, one or more Domain Name Servers may need to be contacted, in a prioritized order until the name can be successfully resolved. The Domain Search list for a network is an ordered list of DNS server addresses that should be used to resolve names on that network.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The DHCP Client does not automatically use the Domain Search List to configure the DNS Client to resolve names based on the list. This may be a future enhancement, when the DNS Client provides a way to configure it to use such a list. In the meantime, if name resolution needs to be performed based on this list, it would have to be implemented at an application level. An application would need to acquire the Domain Search List using the DhcpOptionMgr and then utilize the information provided in that list to drive an explicit process of requesting name resolution from the DNS Servers for the listed domains</p>
