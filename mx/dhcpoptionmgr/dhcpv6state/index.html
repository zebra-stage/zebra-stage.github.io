        <p>This is the On/Off switch for the DHCPv6 client, which enables the device to acquire an IPv6 address. When enabled (option 1), the client obtains an IPv6 Global Address (GA) from the DHCPv6 server in a stateful manner. When disabled (option 2), the client acquires an IPv6 address using the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) protocol. <strong><u>See important device-staging notes</u> by hovering over the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color:#108CED;"></i> in the table below</strong>. </p>
