        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Doze Mode energy saving features on the device. When Doze Mode is enabled, only apps specifically added to the "exemption whitelist" can <i><b>prevent</b></i> the device from entering this low-power state. Apps are added to the exemption whitelist using the <a href="/mx/appmgr/#prevent-doze-mode">App Manager &gt; Prevent Doze Mode</a> parameter.</p>
