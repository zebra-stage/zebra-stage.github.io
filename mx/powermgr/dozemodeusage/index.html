        <p>This is the On/Off switch for Doze Mode, a set of energy-saving Android features designed to help maximize device usage while on battery. By default, all apps allow the device to enter Doze Mode during periods of inactivity. <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> <strong>NOTE</strong>: In cases that require one or more apps to be available at all times, such as for communcations or real-time notifications, it's possible to configure such app(s) (when running) to <i><b>prevent</b></i> the device from entering Doze Mode (when Doze Mode is enabled). For more information, see <a href="/mx/appmgr/#prevent-doze-mode">App Manager &gt; Doze Mode</a> parameters.</p>
