<p>For example, if the <code>.zip</code> files <code>M99N0KXXVPUCP14500.zip</code> and <code>CFE-M99-L-N0-010101_G_00_02.zip</code> are to be applied in that order, an OS Update text file should be created as follows: </p>

-->

<ul>
<li><strong>Device "Reset" commands are supported for use within a <code>.upl</code> file <u>only on devices running Android 10</u></strong>. Other devices must execute all required reset(s) using Reset Actions in one or more StageNow Profile(s). See syntax, below. </li>

<li><strong>Zebra recommends <u>matching case when entering file names</u></strong> to avoid case-sensitivity errors on some devices. </li>

<li><strong>Required file(s) must be on the device before a Reset Action</strong> is initiated.</li>

<li>The <code>.upl</code> file and all referenced <code>.zip</code> files must be <strong>in the same device folder</strong>. </li>

<li>The folder used for storing file(s) must be a supported location according to the Android Location/Device Location Rules below. </li>

<li><strong>Location rules and characteristics vary by device</strong>. </li>

<li><strong>The following devices <u>do not support</u> <code>.upl</code> files</strong>:


<ul>
<li><strong>TC70 KitKat</strong></li>

<li><strong>TC75 KitKat</strong></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="deviceresetcommands" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#deviceresetcommands"><span></span></a>Device Reset Commands</h4>

<p>Device "Reset" commands are supported for use within a <code>.upl</code> file <strong><u>only on devices running Android 10</u></strong> and only using the syntax below.  </p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>
// On devices running Android 10 (or later) the "osupdate.upl" text file can contain
// one or more Reset commands using the following syntax:

command:FactoryReset
command:EnterpriseReset

// See the Overview section for more information about resetting the device. 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="androidfilelocationrules" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#androidfilelocationrules"><span></span></a>Android File Location Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Update file location must not be blocked</strong> by <a href="/mx/sdcardmgr">SdCardMgr</a> or any other means. </li>

<li><strong>Removable media must be physically present</strong>. Storage partitions implemented on a removable medium such as a Micro SD Card must be inserted in the device when the Reset Action is initiated. </li>

<li><strong>The location must not be encrypted</strong>. A location that is encrypted cannot be used for OS Updates. For example, if Full Storage Card Encryption is enabled for a particular Storage Card, that card contains no suitable locations for OS Updates. Similarly, if an Encrypted File System was mounted on a Storage Card, that card also would be unsuitable for OS Updates.</li>

<li><strong>The update entity must have write permissions</strong> in the update file location. </li>

<li><strong>Emulated Storage Cards are not supported on Jelly Bean</strong>. Devices running KitKat and higher are not effected by this limitation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://source.android.com/devices/storage/adoptable">Adoptable Storage</a> is not supported</strong>. Zebra devices by default do not implement the Android Adoptable Storage spec, which formats the SD Card for use with a single device. An Adoptable SD Card cannot be used to store update files. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: The path specified using this parameter would normally be the same as the path to which the file was written when it was transferred to the device. However, path names can sometimes appear to be different while ending at the same destination, and it's possible that some such paths will fail to initiate an OS Update when specified using this parameter. Therefore, <strong>Zebra recommends using paths in the following table when entering the OS Update file to the PowerMgr</strong>.</p>
