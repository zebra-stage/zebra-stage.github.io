        <p>Controls whether to bypass the Android "setup wizard" (also known as the "Welcome Screen") following any Enterprise Reset. <strong>Applies only on devices with Google Mobile Services (GMS)</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important: Once applied, this setting persists on the device</strong> and is effective following all subsequent Enterprise Resets until it is explicitly changed using PowerMgr or cleared by initiating a Factory Reset. </p>

<!-- 6/15/21- removed per eng.
If SUW bypass is desired following an Enterprise Reset, this parameter must be included and set to "true" in the same Profile that is used to initiate the Enterprise Reset. The bypass flag was intended to be available as an option ONLY when Enterprise Reset is selected. However, **MX 7.1 and 7.2 allow SUW bypass to be configurable regardless of the Enterprise Reset parameter setting**. Once pushed to such devices, a bypass flag value of "true" will persist until an Enterprise Reset is executed or the flag is changed to "false" by a subsequent profile.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once running, the setup wizard can be exited <strong>on some devices</strong> by scanning a barcode. <a href="/stagenow/latest/Profiles/wipedevice/#setupwizardmanualbypass">More info</a>. </p>
