        <p>Controls whether to bypass the Android "setup wizard" (also known as the "Welcome Screen") following any Enterprise Reset. <strong>Applies only on devices with Google Mobile Services (GMS)</strong>. <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> Once applied, this setting persists on the device and is effective following all subsequent Enterprise Resets until it is explicitly changed using PowerMgr or cleared by a Factory Reset.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> <strong>This feature is discontinued on devices running Android 13 and later</strong>. However, bypass is still supported if data entered through the Setup Wizard was configured to persist on the device. Learn <a href="/mx/persistmgr">about data persistence</a>.</p>
