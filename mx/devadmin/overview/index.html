        <p>The Device Administrator CSP (DevAdmin) controls which apps have administrative privileges, can access Android Device Admin APIs and how, when and whether the Screen-Lock is invoked.</p>

<p>Android defines some APIs as Device Administration APIs, as implemented within the DevicePolicyManager class. These APIs enable applications to perform tasks that can affect the security of the device. As such, they are restricted to specially approved "Device Administrator" applications. If an application is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model and is approved to become a Device Administrator, then it can use some or all of the Device Administration APIs.</p>

<p>In standard Android devices, an application that is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model must explicitly request the device user to approve it as a Device Administrator. This is based on the assumption that the device user is knowledgeable enough to make this determination. For a device that is owned and/or used by a single user, that assumption might be reasonable. For an Enterprise-owned device that might be shared among multiple device users, that assumption may be a poor one.</p>

<p>The DevAdmin provides direct access to certain device administration tasks and allows programmatic approval as a Device Administrator of applications written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model without involving or notifying the device user. This allows an Enterprise to grant its own trusted applications access to the Device Administration APIs, thus enabling those applications to perform device administration tasks.</p>
