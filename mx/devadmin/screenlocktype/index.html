        <p>Controls whether a screen lock will be invoked when the device powers up or user inactivity exceeds the Screen-Lock Timeout Interval parameter, and which Android Lock Screen will be displayed. </p>

<p><code>ENTERPRISE HOME SCREEN NOTE:</code> Installation of <a href="/ehs">Zebra EHS</a> by default disables the Android Settings panel on devices, which causes any execution of this parameter to fail. To use this parameter on devices intended to run EHS, <strong>Zebra recommends setting the ScreenLockType <em><u>before</u></em> EHS is installed on target device(s)</strong>. To set the ScreenLockType on devices already running EHS, enable EHS <a href="https://techdocs.zebra.com/ehs/latest/guide/features/#privilegedsettings">Privileged Settings</a> on the device(s) to temporarily activate the Settings app, set the ScreenLockType as desired, then disable Privileged Settings to re-secure the device. </p>
