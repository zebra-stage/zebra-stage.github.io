        <p>Used to select an Action to perform for creating new or designating existing Function Groups. A Function Group is a set of functions that an administrator can designate as "sensitive" and worthy of protection from unauthorized use by apps. For example, a "Communications" Function Group might designate certain functions from CellularMgr, GprsMgr and Wi-Fi CSPs as sensitive and limit access to authorized apps only. </p>

<p><strong>By default, all features are Unprotected and all apps are Authorized to access all functions</strong>. Once a Function Group is created and set as Protected, all apps are prevented from accessing functions within that group <strong><em>except</em></strong> apps specifically Approved for access. </p>
