        <p>Used to add Packages to the "whitelist," which prevents the app from submitting XML. To allow an app to submit XML, see the "Add Packages and Allow to Submit XML" parameter. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to understand that if an application uses the AccessMgr to turn on Whitelisting, the app itself becomes subject to Whitelisting. If the app does not add itself to the "white list," that application is prevented from running. Also, if such an app does not explicitly allow itself to submit XML, it is not able to alter that configuration once successfully applied.</p>
