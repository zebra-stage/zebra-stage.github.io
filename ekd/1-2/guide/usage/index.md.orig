## Overview
The Enterprise Keyboard Designer (EKD) is a powerful key-layout editor for Windows 7, 8 and 10. It provides a graphical interface for creating and modifying custom key layouts for Enterprise Keyboard, Zebra's replacement for the stock Android keyboard designed specifically for the workplace. 

<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="ekd_01.png"/>

An unlimited number of custom key layouts can be created, deployed to devices and called by customer apps (through Android intents) as needed to match specific types of input.  Pre-installed on many Zebra devices and also available as a side-load, Zebra Enterprise Keyboard (EKB) must be installed to make use of custom EKD layouts. 

<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="ekd_02.png"/>


EKD features a simple drag-and-drop UI with device emulation allows quick creation of purpose-built key layouts configured for specific key actions that can be modified for different devices and screen resolutions. An optional layout grid ensures precise and uniform key placement.

##### IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES - PLEASE READ
* **The Zebra Enterprise Keyboard MUST be installed on the device and selected as the default input source** to make use of custom layouts created with EKD. 
>>>>>>> 94adfbed23194bbab916067d2cecfee69a5fcce9
* **<u>Only one keyboard or custom key layout can be displayed on the device screen at a time</u>**. When a custom key layout is displayed, all other keyboards are hidden, including the (alpha-numeric) Enterprise Keyboard. 
* **Custom layouts must be called by an app using intents** (see [Intent APIs section](#intentapis)).
* Multiple layouts can be saved in a single file, but only a single file can be accessed by apps on the device.  
* EKD projects are automatically saved and deployed as encrypted files that can be decrypted only by **DataWedge, Enterprise Browser and Enterprise Keyboard**, applications running on a Zebra Android device, or by the **Enterprise Keyboard Designer** tool itself. 
* Layout files can be imported into the Enterprise Keyboard Designer and modified or supplemented with additional keys or layouts. 
* **Zebra recommends resetting to the default input device when quitting an app that uses EKB**. 
* In this guide, the terms “button” and “key” are used interchangeably. 

-----

### Installation
EKD is instaled in the same was as any Windows application. 

1. Download the “CustomKeyboardDesignerUtility.exe” onto the target Windows system. 
2. Double-click .exe file to install.
3. Enterprise Keyboard Designer launches automatically after installation.

-----

### Using EKD

Each Enterprise Keyboard Designer project contains one or more key layouts saved as a single encrypted file. The project name becomes the file name, with “`.encrypted`” as the file extension (i.e. “`myTC75Layout.encrypted`”). 

#### I. Create a Project

In the Custom Enterprise Keyboard Designer Utility: 
Click “New keyboard Project” 
Enter a project name and click “Submit” or press ENTER
Select a target device from the drop-down and click “Confirm” 
Select the device orientation and click “Confirm”

When the project name is seen in the top-left corner, the workspace is ready to create new Layouts. Note: Project-level settings cannot be changed later.

For a demo of the steps above, see the "createProject.mp4” video.

Create a Layout
A Layout is defined as any grouping of keys. Layouts are created using “drag and drop” or the “grid layout” option. Layout names must be unique and contain only alpha-numeric characters.


1. Click on the Menu button to open the sidebar:
<b>Switch layouts with taps or swipes</b> across the keypad:  
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="ekd_03.png"/>
<br>
2. Click the add button icon (+):
<b>Switch layouts with taps or swipes</b> across the keypad:  
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="ekd_04.png"/>
<br>
3. Specify a name and press ENTER:
<b>Switch layouts with taps or swipes</b> across the keypad:  
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="ekd_05.png"/>
<br>
4. To modify an existing Layout, click the EDIT icon; <br>To delete, click the TRASH icon: 
<b>Switch layouts with taps or swipes</b> across the keypad:  
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="ekd_06.png"/>
<br>

Using drag and drop
1. Select the Layout to edit (if not already selected).
2. With the mouse pointer on the (simulated) device screen, drag to create a Key Layout Background in approximately the desired position on the simulator. Once created, the Layout can be repositioned on the device by dragging. To resize, grab and drag the right or bottom edges. 
3. Drag the desired key(s) from the key panel (at right) to the new Key Layout Background. Drag to reposition. 
4. Save your progress using the “Save Layout” button. There is no confirmation window when saving.

`**IMPORTANT**:` Always save the current Layout before switching to another. Otherwise changes to the current Layout are lost. 

Using Grid Layout
The Grid Layout option permits button Layouts to be created more quickly and with more precision than the drag-and-drop method. When a Grid is initially created, it is automatically placed with its left and bottom edges flush with the left and bottom edges of the simulator.  

1. Create or open a Layout to edit (if not already open). 
2. Check the “Create Grid Layout” checkbox. This enables parameters to be entered in the Grid Properties input fields shown below. Configure the values as required (in pixels or count, as applicable). Changes are immediately visible in the Layout. 
Grid Properties:

** Left -** Layout offset (in pixels) from the left edge of the screen.

**Top -** Layout offset (in pixels) from the top edge of the screen.

**Width -** Overall width (in pixels) of the Layout.

**Height -** Overall height (in pixels) of the Layout.

**Rows -** Number of rows in the Layout, divided equally across the specified Height.

**Columns -** Number of columns in the Layout, divided equally across the specified Width. 

**Margin -** Distance (in pixels) between Grid boxes, each of which stores one Button.

3. Click on “Save Grid Layout” button (in the Layout Properties panel) to store changes to the Layout.
4. Configure Button Properties and functions as required (see below).  
5. Configure Layout Properties as required (see below).

**To push a keyboard definition file**:

1. On the development host computer, locate the custom keyboard definition file (i.e. “EKBCustomLayouts.encrypted”) that contains the desired layouts.
2. In the device Settings panel, set Enterprise Keyboard as a default IME.
3. Push definition file to the following folder on the device: 
 
`/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/`

Custom keyboard layouts are available for selection immediately upon deployment of the file. 

-----

### Recommendations
* The Enterprise Keyboard Designer must only be used in full screen mode. Resizing the Enterprise Keyboard Designer application window after starting a Project can result in unpredictable behavior. 
* The number of allowable characters in a button label field is dependent on width of the key. To avoid automatic key resizing, button label should not exceed available width. 
* The font size used for a button label is dependent on the size of the key being labelled. To avoid automatic key resizing, select a point size appropriate for the size of the button.
* The secondary text button label field is dependent on the width of the key key. To avoid automatic key resizing, the secondary button label should not exceed available width.
* Zebra recommends that the Button image size not exceed 100 kb. Larger images are supported but might impact performance of the layout. 
* The following reserved names must not be used in Model Input fields (PressAction, LongPressAction, etc.) or in KeyEvents: Scantrigger, deviceInfo, calculator, switch-abc, switch-123, switch-# * /, switch-scan, customLayout, key-, keyincaps.  

### Known Issues
When switching layouts, a thin white line is sometimes shown at the bottom or sides of the background key layout in the device simulator, but has no effect on the simulated display.
