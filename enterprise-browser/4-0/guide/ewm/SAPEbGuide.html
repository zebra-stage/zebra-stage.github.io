<h2 id="1introduction" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#1introduction"><span></span></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>SAP EWM is an Android app runs on Zebra scanner devices. The App is capable of executing EWM
use cases by connecting directly to a S4HANA cloud instance.</p>

<p><code>
Figure 1 : Device to S4HANA connection
</code></p>

<h2 id="2prerequisite" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#2prerequisite"><span></span></a>2. Prerequisite</h2>

<ul>
<li>The user of the APP should have a valid S4HANA user name a password</li>

<li>The target Zebra devices should have active internet connection,</li>

<li>The app is installed and properly licensed</li>

<li>S4HANA cloud instance should be reachable from the target device</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3installation" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#3installation"><span></span></a>3. Installation</h2>

<p>The installer is in the form of APK and it can be transferred to the device and installed by executing
the apk.</p>

<p>The apk name is EnterpriseBrowser_SAP_<version>.apk</version></p>

<h2 id="31installationsteps" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#31installationsteps"><span></span></a>3.1. Installation steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Store the apk in some place in the laptop</p></li>

<li><p>Connect the Zebra device with the laptop via cable</p></li>

<li><p>Make the device mode as file transfer</p></li>

<li><p>Browse the device file location from the laptop using laptop’s file explorer and place the apk
inside the device</p></li>

<li><p>In the device move to the location where the apk file is placed</p></li>

<li><p>Tap on the apk file to install the app.</p></li>

<li><p>On successful installation the following icon will appear in the screen</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="4execution" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#4execution"><span></span></a>4. Execution</h2>

<p>On successful installation first time executing the app following screen will appear.</p>

<p>To make it work in for SAP EWM the mode of the application required to be changed through
configuration</p>

<p>After first run tap on “Return to OS button” to exit from the application</p>

<h2 id="5applicationconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#5applicationconfiguration"><span></span></a>5. Application configuration</h2>

<p>From the file explorer view in laptop the app folder location should look like the following.</p>

<p>Hit the ‘Return to OS’ button to exit from the App.</p>

<p>There is a configuration file “config.xml” available inside the folder. By using the laptop file explorer
move to the location where the App is installed.</p>

<p>Copy the Config.xml file from device to laptop</p>

<p>Open the Config.xml file in any text editor</p>

<p>Add / Modify the following values</p>

<ol>
<li>Under <configuration><navigation> tag set the values of ‘Cookies’ and ‘ThirdPartyCookies’ as
the following</navigation></configuration></li>
</ol>

<p><code>
&lt;Navigation&gt;
&lt;Cookies value="1"/&gt;
&lt;ThirdPartyCookies value="1"/&gt;
&lt;/Navigation&gt;
</code></p>

<ol>
<li>Under <configuration><screen> tag set the values of ‘EnableZoom’ as the following</screen></configuration></li>
</ol>

<p><code>
&lt;Screen&gt;
&lt;EnableZoom value="0"/&gt;
&lt;/Screen&gt;
</code></p>

<ol>
<li>Under <configuration> add the following tags</configuration></li>
</ol>

<p><code>
&lt;SapEwm&gt;
&lt;SapUrl value="{sap url} "/&gt;
&lt;Warehouse value="{Warehouse}"/&gt;
&lt;Resource value = "{Resource}"/&gt;
&lt;Plant value = "{Plant}"/&gt;
&lt;/SapEwm&gt;
</code>
<code>
Once the values are provided configuration should look something like the following
</code>
<code>
&lt;SapEwm&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>
&lt;SapUrl value="https://my302 438 - api.s4hana.ondemand.com"/&gt;
&lt;Warehouse value="Z254"/&gt;
&lt;Resource value = "MOBILE 2"/&gt;
&lt;Plant value = "1710"/&gt;
&lt;/SapEwm&gt;
</code></p>

<ol>
<li>Under <applications><applications> <intentreceiver> tag add ‘DWProfileName’ tag and
provide values of intents. This is set to receive scan data from DataWedge ( Another APP resides
in the device) through intent. In normal condition (fresh installation )the values provided in the
following example should be used</intentreceiver></applications></applications></li>
</ol>

<p><code>
&lt;IntentReceiver&gt;
&lt;EnableReceiver value="1"/&gt;
&lt;IntentAction value="com.zebra.action.DEFAULT"/&gt;

<li><strong>Under</strong> Under <applications><applications><sip> tag set the ResizeOnButtonbar value as
following</sip></applications></applications></li>
</ol>

<p><code>
&lt;SIP&gt;
&lt;ResizeOnButtonbar value="1"/&gt;
&lt;/SIP&gt;
</code>
Save the Config.xml and transfer back to the device</p>

<p>Start the app again</p>

<p>On successful configuration following screen will appear.</p>

<p>SAP server input box show the url of the SAP server provided in the Config.xml. If required end user
may change it. The modified value will be updated in the Config.xml file. Once modified the app will
continue use the modified url.</p>

<h2 id="6login" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#6login"><span></span></a>6. Login</h2>

<p>Once login the app automatically logs in to the Resource mentioned in the configuration.</p>

<p>The following screen should appear with all the menus enabled</p>

<p>If login to resource is not successful due to wrong value in configuration file or due to the resource is
already occupied then the menu ‘WM Workflows’ will be in disable state. User need to go to ‘App
configuration’ to provide the correct values.</p>

<p>If configuration does not have any Plant value then the menu ‘IM Workflows’ will also be disabled.</p>

<h2 id="7editconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#7editconfiguration"><span></span></a>7. Edit configuration</h2>

<p>User can change the Warehouse, Resource and Plant values if required.</p>

<p>To modify those values go to ‘App Configuration’ option.</p>

<p>Following screen will appear.</p>

<p>Provide values and choose confirm. The app first logs off from current resource the logon to new
resource.</p>

<p>On success it will enable the menus to execute use cases.</p>

<h2 id="8usecaseexecution" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#8usecaseexecution"><span></span></a>8. Use case execution..........................................................................................................................</h2>

are from IM workflows</p>

<p>Following picture shows the navigations from main screen to execute different use cases</p>

<p>Most of the inputs are expected as scan input through device scanner. There are some inputs like
quantity where keyboard would popup automatically. However for all scan input there will option to
provide input through keyboard too.</p>
