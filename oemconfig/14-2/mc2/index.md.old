<b><font size="4" color="red">For devices with Android 11, Android 13 and later.</font></b><br>

This guide documents managed configurations contained in the "Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX" schema, the most recent edition. **This version *<u>MUST</u>* be used when targeting Zebra devices running Android 13 and later**. For devices running Android 11, this is one of *two* compatible OEMConfig versions. This version is *<u>NOT</u>* compatible with devices running Android 10 or older Android versions. **The OEMConfig app package corresponding to this schema is** `com.zebra.oemconfig.release`. For targeting other devices, **[see Legacy Zebra OEMConfig schema docs](../mc)**. Learn more [about legacy devices](../faq/#qwhatislegacyzebraoemconfig).

#### Use this guide if: 
* **Targeting devices with <u>Android 13 or later</u>** <br>
***<u>OR</u>...***
* **Targeting devices with <u>Android 11</u>&#42; <br>
*<u>AND</u>...***
* **All desired features were present in <u><font size="3" color="red">MX 11.5 or *earlier*</font></u>** (recommended)<br><i><font size="2" color="DimGrey"> &#42; Potential staging errors. See important note, below.</font></i>

### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ 
**<u>If targeting devices running Android 11</u>**: Google-mandated Android security enhancements required major changes to the OEMConfig schema. To help facilitate the transition for customers, Zebra developed MX 11 to be compatible with *both* the original OEMConfig schema and the mandate-compliant schema under development at the time. For a period of time, this required implementation of MX features in *both* schemas. That period ended with the completion of **<u>MX 11.5, the last version with the same set of features in both schemas**</u>. 

From that point onward, only "OEMConfig Powered by MX" continued to gain new MX functionality. Therefore, **<u>if using OEMConfig 13.x to target devices running Android 11, the EMM console could present features absent from one or more targeted devices</u>** (depending on the MX version installed on the target(s)). **Attempts to configure any such setting would result in a staging error**.

> <i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color:#27AE60;"></i> For a list of MX features, refer to the [MX Feature Matrix](/mx). Use SmartDocs to filter by version.

-----

### Android 11 Notes
* **If targeting devices running <u>Android 11 and/or OLDER</u>**: 
 * Zebra recommends using [Legacy Zebra OEMConfig](../mc) and its original schema for full compatibility.
 * Legacy OEMConfig can be used indefinitely to target all devices with Android versions prior to Android 13. 
 * If using OEMConfig 13.x to target devices running Android 11, some MX features configurable through the EMM console might not be present on the device. 
* <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color:#FF0000;"></i> **Targeting devices with Android versions older *AND* newer than Android 11 requires the use of *<u>BOTH</u>* OEMConfig versions**.

<!-- removed; implies no ST 
  *  **Some MX features might not be available on Android 11 devices that contain MX 13.x**.

## Type Styling

- ***Bold Italic type*** indicates ***values*** of a *Managed Configuration* such as ***On*** or ***Enable***.

- **Bold type** indicates the name of an *MC*, *Group*, *Sub-group*, or *Sub-array*, such as the **System Configuration** *Group*, the **Keyboard Configuration** *Sub-group*, the **Packages** *Sub-array*, or the **State** *Managed Configuration*.

- *Italic type* is used for *emphasis* and for referencing *Defined Terms*, such as *Sub-group* and *Instance*. Defined terms are *Capitalized* to differentiate them from italics used solely for *emphasis*.


## Android Terms

- *Android Package*

>An *Android Package* is how executable code is packaged for execution on Android devices. *Android Packages* can be built-into the Operating System image (OS), in which case they are referred to as being built-in, pre-loaded, or pre-installed. *Android Packages* that are not built-in can be added to an Android device by downloading and installing them, in which case they are referred to as post-loaded, post-installed, or installable. Each *Android Package* is identified by a unique *Android Package Name* and can contain one or more *Android Activities* and/or *Android Services*.

>Android defines a series of standard behaviors that will generally be exhibited by *Android Packages* which may vary based on whether an *Android Package* is pre-loaded or post-loaded and based on whether the *Android Package* is *Trusted* or *Non-Trusted*. Most *Android Packages* will fall into one of the following basic types:

- *Built-in System Application*

>A *Built-in System Package* is pre-loaded as part of the OS and is granted special *System Permissions* on the device. This makes it a *Trusted Package* and allows it to interact with system services and use *System APIs* that are not available to *Non-Trusted Packages*. Zebra carefully controls and vets all such *Android Packages* before building them into the OS to ensure that they are safe and contribute beneficially to the overall device experience without creating performance, security, or usability issues.

- *Built-in Non-System Package*

>A *Built-in Non-System Package* is pre-loaded as part of the OS but is not granted any special *System Permissions* on the device. This makes it a *Non-Trusted Package* and allows it to interact with system services and to use *System APIs* that are not available to *Non-Trusted Packages*. Zebra carefully controls and vets all such Android Packages* before building them into the OS to ensure that they contribute beneficially to the overall device experience without creating performance or usability issues.

- *Installable System Package*

>An *Installable System Package* must be post-loaded, since it is not part of the OS but is granted special *System Permissions* on the device. This makes it a *Trusted Package* and allows it to interact with system services and to use*System APIs* that are not available to *Non-Trusted Packages*. Only Zebra can provide such Android Packages* and Zebra carefully controls and vets all such Android Packages* it provides before they are published to ensure that they are safe and contribute beneficially to the overall device experience without creating performance, security, or usability issues. Ultimately, the decision of whether to install such an Android Package* on a device is the responsibility of the Device Administrator.

- *Installable Non-System Package*

>An *Installable Non-System Package* must be post-loaded, since it is not part of the OS and is not granted any special *System Permissions* on the device. This makes it an*Non-Trusted Package* and prevents it from interacting with system services and from using *System APIs* that are not available to *Non-Trusted Packages*. Zebra carefully controls and vets all such Android Packages* before they are published to ensure that they contribute beneficially to the overall device experience without creating performance or usability issues. Zebra cannot and does not control or guarantee the suitability of such Android Packages* that it does not provide. Ultimately, evaluating such an Android Package* and deciding whether to install it on a device is the responsibility of the Device Administrator.

- *Android Package Name*

>An *Android Package Name* is a string that uniquely identifies one or more versions of an *Android Package*.

- *Android Application*

>An *Android Application* refers to an *Android Package* that contains at least one *Android Activity* and therefore has some in-device UI for interacting with the User to differentiate it from other *Android Packages* that may only have *Android Services* and therefore have no UI for interacting with the User.

- *Android Status Bar*

>The *Android Status Bar* is an area at the top edge of the screen on an Android device where various status information can be displayed to the User.

- *Android Notification Bar*

>The *Android Notification Bar* is an area at the bottom edge of the screen on an Android device where soft buttons are provided to allow the User to navigate within the UI of the device.


## Managed Configuration Terms

- *MC*

>See *Managed Configuration*.

- *Managed Configuration*

>A *Managed Configuration* is a single configurable item, defined within the OEMConfig Schema, that can be used, alone or in conjunction with other *MCs*, to change some aspect of device behavior.

- *Schema*

>See *Managed Configuration Schema*.

- *Managed Configuration Schema*

>A *Managed Configuration Schema* is a definition of all the of the *Managed Configuration* that are supported by a given application.

- *Group*

>See *Managed Configuration Group*.

- *Managed Configuration Group*

>A *Managed Configuration Group* is a collection of *Sub-groups* or *Sub-arrays* that are defined to control multiple related aspects of device behavior (such as **System Configuration** or **UI Configuration**). A *Group* can include no more than one instance of any *Sub-group* or *Sub-array* that is defined for that *Group*.

- *Sub-group*

>A *Sub-group* is a collection of *MCs*, *Sub-groups*, or *Sub-arrays* that can be used to control some sub-aspect of device behavior (such as the **Clock Configuration** *Sub-group* within the **System Configuration** *Group*). A *Sub-group* can include no more than one instance of any *MC*, *Sub-group*, or *Sub-array* defined for that *Sub-group*.

- *Sub-array*

>A *Sub-array* is an ordered list of instances of a SINGLE *Sub-group*, each of which can contain anything that is defined for that *Sub-group*. The *only* time the same *MC*, *Sub-group*, or *Sub-array* can be included more than once into the same *Sub-group* is when it appears within different *Instances* of that *Sub-group* within a *Sub-array*.


## OEMConfig Terms

- *OEMConfig*

>*OEMConfig* is a term invented by Zebra and adopted by Google to refer to an OEM-specific application that exposes *Managed Configurations* which it uses to enable configuration of OEM-specific features of the device rather than to configure application features.

- *Zebra OEMConfig*

>*Zebra OEMConfig* is a term used by Zebra to refer to Zebra-specific *OEMConfig* application(s) provided by Zebra to configure Zebra Android devices.

- *Zebra OEMConfig Schema*

>*Zebra OEMConfig Schema* is a term used to refer to a *Schema* for a *Zebra OEMConfig* application.

- *Zebra OEMConfig Old Schema*

>*Zebra OEMConfig Old Schema* is a term used to refer to the *Zebra OEMConfig Schema* defined for the old version of the *Zebra OEMConfig* application with package name "com.zebra.oemconfig.common" and intended for use on Zebra Android devices with Android 11 or lower.

- *Zebra OEMConfig New Schema*

>*Zebra OEMConfig New Schema* is a term used to refer to the *Zebra OEMConfig Schema* defined for the new version of the *Zebra OEMConfig* application with package name "com.zebra.mdna.oemconfig" and intended for use on Zebra Android devices with Android 11 or higher.


## Zebra OEMConfig Terms

- *Setting*

>A *Setting* is a *Managed Configuration* defined in a *Zebra OEMConfig Schema* that is used to enable configuration of some aspect of device behavior. A *Setting* generally affects the ongoing behavior of a device from the time it is applied until some subsequent time when it is changed to a new value. The order of configuration of different *Settings* is generally expected to have little or no impact on the end result. Further, it is generally is expected to be safe to set a *Setting* to the same value repetitively with no negative impact. Common examples of *Settings* include display timeout and network configuration.

- *Action*

>An *Action* is a *Managed Configuration* defined in a *Zebra OEMConfig Schema* that is used to enable performance on a device of some operation that takes place during some unit of time, that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and then is over. An *Action* MAY, but doesn’t always, cause a change in the device state that affects ongoing behavior of a device. An *Action* MAY be REPEATED, but should NEVER be AUTOMATICALLY repeated and should be repeated ONLY when EXPLICITLY requested by an administrator. When an *Action* is repeated, the corresponding operation will occur again and that MIGHT produce negative or undesirable behavior if done unintentionally or unexpectedly. In many cases, the ORDER in which multiple different *Actions* are performed can be quite important since it can affect the actual outcome. Common examples of *Actions* include performing a reboot, uninstalling an application, or wiping an SD card. The *Zebra OEMConfig Old Schema* heavily relied on *Actions*, but Google has since discouraged the use of *Actions* in *OEMConfig* applications because it can be difficult or even impossible to reliably enforce ordering and prevent repetition. For this reason, the *Zebra OEMConfig New Schema* eliminated all support for *Actions*.

- *Argument*

>An *Argument* is a parameter specified for an *Action* that defines or adjusts the operation performed by that *Action*. Most *Actions* have at least one *Argument* and some *Actions* have multiple *Arguments*. Each invocation of an *Action* may have different *Arguments* to suit the reason why the *Action* is being performed.

- *Condition*

>A *Condition* is a criteria defining when an *Action* should be performed. *Actions* are generally invoked when an administrator determines that the .*Conditions* are appropriate to require the operation defined by that *Action* and its *Arguments* to be performed.

- *Rule*

>A *Rule* is a *Setting* defined in a *Zebra OEMConfig Schema* that is used to configure a device to perform some defined operation at some time in the future when certain defined *Conditions* are met. Every *Rule* must specify information that defines an operation to be performed AND information that defines the *Conditions* when that operation should be performed. In many cases, an *Action* can be converted into one or more *Rules* to help conform to the Google recommendation that *OEMConfig* applications should ONLY support *Settings* and NOT *Actions*. Because a *Rule* is a *Setting*, it doesn't cause the operation to be performed when it is configured, but instead sets the operation up to be performed in the future. As a result, it is generally unnecessary to worry about the order in which *Rules* are configured or about preventing the repetition of the configuration of *Rules*. Common examples of *Rules* include configuring a device to automatically download a file when it is not already on a device or configuring a device to update its OS when it is out of date. The *Zebra OEMConfig New Schema* heavily relies on *Rules* to replace functionality that was previously supported in the the *Zebra OEMConfig Old Schema* via *Actions*.

- *Array of Rules*

>An *Array of Rules* is a mechanism that uses an *Array* of *Rules* to replace an *Action*. Most *Actions* require *Arguments* to define variations in the operation to be performed and each invocation of an *Action* could have a different combination of *Arguments*. To provide a similar capability, an *Array of Rules* can be created where each element of the *Array* contains a different set of *Arguments* and thus defines a slightly different operation to be performed. Since each element of the *Array* is a *Rule*, each element of the *Array* must also include information that describes the *Conditions* when the defined operation should be performed. By creating an *Array of Rules* that contains elements that define the required combination of *Arguments* and *Conditions*, comparable results can be achieved without using *Actions*.


## Additional Terms

The above terms have been defined here because they may be generally used throughout this document. Additional terms will be defined in subsequent sections of this document as needed to clarify concepts and usage specific to those sections.


## Reversing a Setting

Managed configurations work to configure devices by pushing a bundle of parameter settings to the target device. To change or undo any previously configured setting, simply resend the same bundle with a new setting, or omit the setting entirely and resend to return the managed configuration to its default.

## Files Configuration



Use this *Array* to configure one or more special handlings for one or more *File(s)*.


*Files* are a fundamental unit of storage in Android, via which data is organized and stored within the storage areas of an Android device. The following terms can help explain how *Files* are used in Android:


>*Device File System*


*Device File System* is generically used to refer to any storage area in an Android device in which data, organized as *Files*, can reside. This term can refer to *Files* that are built into the device, but it is most commonly used to refer to *Files* that are stored in storage areas on the device that can be read and modified during normal device operation, by the Android system and/or by *Android Applications*.


>*Folder*


*Folder* refers to a location in the *Device File System* where *Files* can exist and that can be used to hierarchically organize *Files* into groups.


>*Media Storage*


*Media Storage* is a collection of *Folders* in Android that is generically used to refer to any storage area in the *Device File System* in which common types of media data, organized as *Files*, can reside. This term is most commonly used to refer to *Folders* where media *Files* (such as pictures, video, audio, etc.) can be stored and shared by multiple applications.


>*Application Sandbox*


*Application Sandbox* is a *Folder* in the *Device File System* that is associated with an *Android Application* into which application data, organized as *Files*, can be placed such that they are private to and accessible only by that *Android Application*. This term can apply to private *Files* stored in *Primary Storage*, *Secondary Storage*, or *Portable Storage*. The key criteria that applies to all *Application Sandbox* data, and that differentiates it from other data, is the fact that it is owned by and generally accessible only to the *Android Package* that created it.


>*Shared Folders*


*Shared Folders* refer to *Folders* in the *Device File System* of an Android device in which data, organized as *Files*, can reside and be shared amongst multiple *Android Packages*. Android generally discourages the use of *Shared Folders* and has added more and more restrictions over time to limit their use. In particular, *Scoped Storage* is a recent addition to Android designed to severely restrict the use of *Shared Folders* to share data between *Android Packages*. Android provides other mechanisms, such as Intents, Content and File Providers, and the Storage Access Framework to enable sharing of data amongst *Android Packages* to be done in a more secure and controlled manner than could ever be achieved using *Shared Folders*. For the time being, many Zebra Android devices support the use of the following *Shared Folders*, but these are expected to be phased out over time to better comply with Android standard practice.


- **/data/tmp/public**


The folder **/data/tmp/public** is unique to Zebra Android devices and is commonly used for downloading *Transient* *Files*, such as *Local Update Files* for *OS Updates*.


- **/enterprise/usr**


The folder **/enterprise/usr** is unique to Zebra Android devices, is generally of a relatively small fixed size (e.g. 128MB), and is commonly used for downloading *Persistent* Files, such as *Android Packages* that might need to be re-installed following an *Enterprise Reset*.


Most *Files* stored in the *Device File System* do NOT require any special handling. Most *Files* are created, read, updated, and deleted by the Android system and/or by *Android Applications* on a device without any outside intervention. But some *Files* MAY require special handling, in which case this *Array* is used to identify which *Files* require special handling and what special handling each such *File* requires. There is generally no reason to include a file in this *Array* unless it needs some form of special handling, but a single *File* could have multiple types of special handling. Every element of this *Array* should specify a value for **Device Path And Name** that uniquely identifies a *File* by the path and file name where the *File* resides in the in the *Device File System*.


The following classes of special handling might be required:


- *Download File*


*Download File* special handling would be appropriate when there was a *File* that was created off-device that needed to be delivered to the device to support some system or application service that needed to consume that *File*. For example, a *Local Update File* used to initiate an *OS Update* would generally originate off-device and might need to be Downloaded to a *Shared Folder* before it could be used to initiate such an *OS Update*. A special case of *Download File* special handling is when the *File* to be downloaded is intended for the exclusive use of a single *Android Application*.


- *Upload File*


*Upload File* special handling would be appropriate when there was a *File* that was created by the Android system and/or by *Android Applications* on a device that needed to be Uploaded to somewhere off-device for its eventual consumption there. For example, a Log *File* might be uploaded to a server so it could be used for troubleshooting or analysis.


- *Delete File*


*Delete File* special handling would be appropriate when there was a need for a *File* to be Deleted (removed from the *Device File System*) for some reason NOT driven by the Android system and/or by *Android Applications*. For example, a *File* might be created by an *Android Application* that neglects to delete it, resulting in a large amount of space being occupied. Deleting such a *File* , under the right conditions, could be quite beneficial.


Special handling must be carefully defined to avoid the potential for repetition which could cause harm or negatively impact device performance. For example, repeatedly downloading the same *File* could have multiple negative effects, such as slowing down the device, clogging up the network, wearing out flash memory, etc.


This *Array* is used to specify which *Files* require special handling. Any *File* that does NOT require special handling should not have an element in this *Array*, indicating that NO special handling should be performed. Any *File* that DOES require special handling should not have an element in this *Array* that specifies ALL special handlings required for that *File*.


- If this *Array* has never been specified (never included in the *MCs* sent), then no configuration of special handling will be configured for any *Files*.


- If this *Array* is not specified (not included in the *MCs* sent), then no changes will be made to the configuration defined by any previously specified version of this *Array*.


- If this *Array* is specified (included in the *MCs* sent), then the specified *Array* will entirely replace the configuration defined by any previously specified *Array*.
>Note that it is generally NOT possible to specify an "empty" *Array* (i.e. an *Array* with zero elements). Every *Array* must contain at least one element. Any element(s) in this *Array* where a blank (empty string) value is entered for **Device Path And Name** will be ignored. It is therefore possible to specify a "virtually empty" *Array* by entering a blank (empty string) value for **Device Path And Name** in every element of the *Array*.


- If this *Array* is specified (included in the *MCs* sent), but that *Array* is "virtually empty," as described above, then all special handling previously configured by any previously specified *Array* will be removed, thus returning to a state equivalent to when no *Array* had ever been specified.

Notes:


- If none of **Download Options**, **Upload Options**, or **Delete Options** are specified for a *File*, then NO special handlings CAN occur for that *File*.


- If one or more **Download Options**, **Upload Options**, or **Delete Options** are specified for a *File*, then one or more special handlings MAY occur for that *File*, if/when one or more of the conditions specified for that *File* via **Download Option Type** , **Upload Option Type**, or **Delete Option Type** are met for that *File*.

Enter a string that uniquely identifies a *File* in the *Device File System* for which special handling is required.


For each element in the *Array* **Files Configuration**:


- If no value is specified for this *MC* or if a blank (empty string) value is entered, then the element of the *Array* will be ignored (not processed), producing the same result as if the element of the *Array* was not present. This can be used to effectively remove an element of an *Array* or to create a virtually empty *Array*.


- If a non-blank (non-empty string) value is entered, then the element of the *Array* will be processed and the value entered must uniquely identify a *File* that DOES or COULD exist in the *Device File System*.


- The value entered could take the format /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; to indicate that the *File* is to be downloaded to a *Shared Folder* in the *Device File System*.


- The value entered could take the format /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;, where &lt;filename&gt; includes one or more of the wildcard characters * (Asterisk) or ? *(Question mark) to indicate that all *Files* in the specified path that match are to be uploaded to a Server from a *Shared Folder* in the *Device File System*.

Use this *Sub-array* to configure when/how *Files* should be uploaded to a Server from the *Device File System*.


It is important to understand that due to the one-to-many relationship between Enterprise Mobility Management Systems (EMMs) and devices, the nature of upload is fundamentally different from download. When downloading a *File* from a Server to the *Device File System*, a single *File* on a Server can be downloaded to the same location in the *Device File System* of many devices. But when a *File* in the *Device File System* of many devices is uploaded to the Server, it doesn't make sense for each upload to overwrite a single file on the Server. In order for upload to make sense, each copy of a *File* uploaded by a different device needs to be uploaded to the Server with a different name, to ensure that all uploaded *Files* will be retained. Further, to make the set of uploaded copies of a *File* useful, it is important that the different copies of a *File* uploaded by different devices be somehow associated to the device from which they were uploaded.


Unlike download, which always downloads a single *File* from the Server to the *Device File System* on any given device, upload COULD upload multiple *Files* to the Server from the *Device File System* of a given device. This is accomplished by using the /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; format for **Device Path And Name** where &lt;filename&gt; includes one or more of the wildcard characters * (Asterisk) or ? *(Question mark). All *Files* that match will be uploaded.


Unlike download, which can download the same *File* from the Server to the *Device File System* of many devices, upload may need to upload copies of the same *File* from many devices to the same Server and must therefore name the *Files* from different devices differently on the Server. This is accomplished by specifying only a location via **Upload Server URI** not a specific *File* AND by specifying a pattern via **Upload File Name Pattern** telling upload how to name *Files* from different devices when they are uploaded to a common location on the Server.

Enter a Pattern to be used to craft the names of *Files* uploaded to a Server to ensure that *Files* uploaded from different devices have different names.
The Pattern may contain any characters that are valid for use in a *File* Name on the Server, which may vary by Server but will generally include letters, digits, and a decimal point (dot) and may also contain one or more of the following:
- If the constant value *%model%* appears in the Pattern, then it will be replaced with the model name of the device.
- If the constant value *%serial%* appears in the Pattern, then it will be replaced with the serial number of the device.
- If the constant value *%date%* appears in the Pattern, then it will be replaced with the date the File was created in the *Device File System*.
- If the constant value *%time%* appears in the Pattern, then it will be replaced with the time the File was created in the *Device File System*.


For example, if the Pattern was *Log-%model%-%serial%-%date%-%time%.zip*, a File that is Uploaded to the Server might be assigned the File Name *Log-TC51-123456789-041520-112300.zip*, indicating that the File was a Log File that was Created on a TC51 device whose serial number was *123456789* and where the File was created in the *Device File System* at 11:23 AM on April 15, 2020.

## Keyboard Mappings



Use this *Array* to configure one or more Keyboard Mapping(s)


The following defined terms are important to understand:


>*Key*


*Key* refers to any physical switch that can be activated through manual pressure or any logical (e.g. On-Screen) button that can be activated using a touch panel or other pointing device.


>*Keyboard*


*Keyboard* refers to any input mechanism that utilizes *Keys* that can be pressed to enter data into a mobile device.


>*Built-In Keyboard*


*Built-In Keyboard* refers to a *Keyboard* that is physically integrated with and is generally inseparable from a mobile device and where *Keys* are generally activated by manual pressure.


>*On-Screen Keyboard*


*On-Screen Keyboard* refers to a *Keyboard* that is displayed on the screen and where *Keys* are generally activated by a touch panel or other pointing device. In Android devices, *On-Screen Keyboards* are typically implemented through the Soft Input Panel (SIP) mechanism.


>*External Keyboard*


*External Keyboard* refers to a *Keyboard* that is physically separate from a mobile device and that must be connected to the mobile device via some communications channel, such as Bluetooth or USB, and where *Keys* are generally activated by manual pressure.


>*Key Behavior*


*Key Behavior* refers to what will occur when a *Key* on a *Keyboard* is activated. *Key Behavior* for a *Key* may vary depending on the current *Keyboard State* of a *Keyboard* when the *Key* is activated on that *Keyboard*.


>*Keyboard Mapping*


*Keyboard Mapping* refers to configuration that alters the operation of a *Keyboard* by changing The *Key Behavior* for one or more *Keys* on that *Keyboard*.


>*Keyboard State*


*Keyboard State* refers to a logical state that a *Keyboard* can be in and which affects the *Key Behavior* of *Keys* that are pressed while in that state. Standard *Keyboard States* include *Shift*, *Caps Lock*, *Control*, and *Alt*. *Built-In Keyboards* on Zebra Android devices may also support non-standard *Keyboard States*, such as *Function*, *Blue*, *Orange*, etc.


>*Mapping Table*


*Mapping Table* refers to a table maintained in memory on a Zebra Android device that holds the *Keyboard Mappings* defined for a *Keyboard* that apply to a particular *Keyboard State*. For example, the *Shift* *Mapping Table* for a *Keyboard* would contain *Keyboard Mappings* that apply to *Keys* pressed only when that *Keyboard* is in the *Shift* *Keyboard State*. Consult the product documentation for a Zebra Android device to determine which *Mapping Tables* it supports.


>*Key Identifier*


*Key Identifier* refers to a value used to uniquely identify a *Key* on a *Keyboard* so the *Key Behavior* of that *Key* can be altered via a *Keyboard Mapping* for that *Key*. *Key Identifiers* are most commonly string values that match the label of a *Key*, for *keys* that are labelled. For example, the *Key Identifier* "A" would used to identify a *Key* that is labelled as having that function. In some cases, a *Key* may be labeled with a graphical symbol that cannot easily be represented through a direct text string. For example, the "Left Arrow" *Key* may be labeled with a graphical arrow symbol, in which the *Key Identifier* will attempt to describe that symbol (e.g. "Left"). In some cases, a *Key* may be unlabeled, in which case the *Key Identifier* will attempt to describe the *Key* using functional and/or positional information. For example, the "Volume Up" *Key* is unlabeled and will describe the function of the *Key* (e.g. "Volume Up") and the yellow "Scan" trigger *Key* on the left hand side of the device might be unlabeled and will describe the function and position of the *Key* (e.g. "Left Trigger").


>*Key Code*


*Key Code* refers to a value that is sent to the Android System when a *key* is activated to indicate how the key should be interpreted.


>*Trigger Signal*


*Trigger Signal* refers to a logical indication, on a Zebra Android device, that a *Key* has been activated that is configured to behave as a trigger. Various Zebra Value-Add services, such as Barcode Scanning, are designed to respond to *Trigger Signals*.


This *Array* allows *Keyboard Mappings* to be defined for *Built-In Keyboards* only.


Each element of this *Array*:


- Defines a *Keyboard Mapping* for a single *Key* on the *Built-In Keyboard*, identified by the *Key Identifier* value specified in **Key ID**. By adding multiple elements to this *Array*, *Keyboard Mappings* for multiple *Keys* can be defined.


- Can define the behavior of the identified *Key* in one or more *Mapping Tables* that are supported by the *Built-In Keyboard* on a Zebra Android device. .

Select the name of the *Mapping Table* into which the *Key Behavior* should be stored and which will thereby define the *Keyboard State* in which the *Key* must be activated in order for the *Key Behavior* to occur.


Each *Mapping Table* is associated with a *Keyboard State* and is generally named based on the state *Key* on the *Built-in Keyboard* that causes that *Keyboard State* to be set or cleared.


>Note that due to variations in the size, layout, and intended use cases of *Built-In Keyboards* on various Zebra Android devices, not all *Keyboard States* may be supported on any given device. Consult the product documentation for a device to determine the supported *Keyboard States* and *Mapping Tables*.


Some or all of the following values may be supported by a Zebra Android device:


- If the value ***Base*** is selected, the Base *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Base *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where no *Keyboard States* are set.


- If the value ***Blue*** is selected, the Blue *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Blue *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where the Blue *Key* has been used to set the Blue *Keyboard State*.


- If the value ***Orange*** is selected, the Orange *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Orange *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where the Orange *Key* has been used to set the Orange *Keyboard State*.


- If the value ***Grey*** is selected, the Grey *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Grey *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where the Grey *Key* has been used to set the Grey *Keyboard State*.


- If the value ***Diamond*** is selected, the Diamond *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Diamond *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where the Diamond *Key* has been used to set the Diamond *Keyboard State*.


- If the value ***Shift*** is selected, the Shift *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Shift *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where the Shift *Key* has been used to set the Shift *Keyboard State*.


- If the value ***Control*** is selected, the Control *Mapping Table* will be selected. The Control *Mapping Table* is used to store the *Key Behaviors* that will be performed for *Keys* that are activated under conditions where the Control *Key* has been used to set the Control *Keyboard State*.

Select the type of *Key Behavior* that will be performed when a specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is set.
The following values are supported:

- If the value ***Send Key Code*** is selected, the *Key Behavior* performed when the specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is set will be to send a specified *Key Code*. This can be thought of as being “Classic Keyboard Remapping”, since it causes the standard *Key Behavior* of a *Key*, which is generally to send a standard *Key Code* to be altered to send a different *Key Code*, which may or may not be present on the *Built-In Keyboard* and hence might otherwise not been possible to send without using *Key Mapping*. You must also specify **Send Key Code** to provide the *Key Code* that will be sent.

- If the value ***Send Trigger*** is selected, the *Key Behavior* performed when the specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is set will be to send a *Trigger Signal*. You must also specify **Send Trigger** to select which *Trigger Signal* will be sent,

- If the value ***Launch Application*** is selected, the *Key Behavior* performed when the specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is set will be to launch an application. You must also specify **Launch Application Name** to provide the *Friendly Name* of the application to be launched.

>Note that this is NOT the *Android Package Name*. To launch an application by its *Android Package Name*, the value ***Send Intent*** should be select.

- If the value ***Send Intent*** is selected, the *Key Behavior* performed when the specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is set will be to send an Android Intent

    - Sending an Android Intent provides a very flexible way to specify the *Key Behavior* to be performed for a *Key* by invoking an application or service.

    - There are many options that control the nature of the intent that will be sent.

    - It is generally recommended to fully understand the nature of the Android Intent to be sent before attempting to configure it as a *Key* *Key Behavior*.

    - In many cases, the application or service to be invoked will define the nature of the intent it wishes to receive and that definition can be used to drive the configuration.

    - Android allows a collection of named Extras, of various types, to be attached to any intent.

    - An Intent sent as a *Key Behavior* for a specified *Key* can optionally have up to 5 Extras attached which, if used, MUST always be of type String.

    - This limitation of only attaching up to 5 Extras of type String might prevent certain intents, those which require more Extras or Extras of type other than String, from being sent as a *Key Behavior* for a *Key*.

    - You should consult the documentation or developer of a given application or service to determine the intents it supports and whether a function you want to perform requires any Extra(s) to be attached and, if so, of what type(s).

    - Sending an Android Intent might cause any number of possible results, depending on the nature of the intent configured to be sent.

    - You must also specify some or all of the following to define the Android Intent to be sent:

        - **Intent Method**

        - **Intent Action**

        - **Intent Category**

        - **Intent Package Name**

        - **Intent Class**

        - **Intent Data URI**


        - **Intent Flags**

        - **Intent MIME Type**

        - **Intent Extra Name 1**

        - **Intent Extra Value 1**

        - **Intent Extra Name 2**

        - **Intent Extra Value 2**

        - **Intent Extra Name 3**

        - **Intent Extra Value 3**

        - **Intent Extra Name 4**

        - **Intent Extra Value 4**

        - **Intent Extra Name 5**

        - **Intent Extra Value 5**

- If the value ***Suppress Key*** is selected, NO *Key Behavior* will be performed when the specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is active. This provides a method to change a *Key* to do nothing (act as if it was *Key* has not been activated). - If the value ***Reset To Default*** is selected, the *Key Behavior* performed when the specified *Key* is activated while the *Keyboard State* associated with the specified *Mapping Table* is active be reset back to its default. This will effectively remove any prior mapping of that *Key* in that *Keyboard State* and return the *Key* to its out-of-box *Key Behavior* in that *Keyboard State*.

Select the *Trigger Signal* that will be sent as the *Key Behavior* for a specified *Key* when activated in a specified *Keyboard State* and when the value ***Send Trigger*** is selected for **Behavior Type**.


Eight possible *Trigger Signals* are defined, but not all may be supported on all devices. All devices generally support at least one *Trigger Signal* and generally default to using the first *Trigger Signal* to activate the Barcode Scanner. Some devices may support additional *Trigger Signals* and could be configured to use one or more *Trigger Signals* for some purpose(s) other than Barcode Scanning. Consult the product documentation for a device to determine which *Trigger Signals* are supported and how they are configured by default to be used.

Select the method via which an Android Intent will be sent to invoke an application or service for a specified *Key* when activated in a specified *Keyboard State* and when the value ***Send Intent*** is selected for **Behavior Type**.


Depending on the application or service to be invoked, there is likely only one method that can be used to successfully invoke a desired function in that application or service. You will need to consult the documentation or developer of a given application or service to determine the method via which a particular Android Intent must be sent to produce the desired function.


- If the value ***StartActivity*** is selected, the Android Intent will be sent using the Android startActivity() method. This method is suitable for invoking Android Activities, which are components that perform user interactions. If the function to be invoked involves interacting with the User, this method will most likely be the correct one to use.


- If the value ***Broadcast*** is selected, the Android Intent will be sent using the Android sendBroadcast() method. This method is suitable for invoking Services, which are components that implement background operations. If the function to be invoked does not involve interacting with the User, this method will most likely be the correct one to use.

Enter an Android Intent Action Value for an Intent to be sent to invoke an application or service for a specified Key when activated in a specified *Keyboard State* and when the value ***Send Intent*** is selected for **Behavior Type**.


An Android Intent Action Value is NOT mandatory to specify when sending every Android Intent. An Android Intent Action Value is a commonly used method to identify the purpose of an Android Intent. This can be especially important when the application or service to be invoked supports multiple functions, in which case the Android Intent Action Value is commonly used to identify which function to perform when invoking that application or service. When sending an Implicit Intent, which does not specify an exact recipient application or service, it is also common to use the Android Intent Action Value to indicate the function to be performed by whatever application or service ultimately receives the intent. You should consult the documentation or developer of a given application or service to determine the intents it supports and whether a function you want to perform requires an Android Intent Action Value to be supplied.

An Android Package Name Value is NOT mandatory to specify when sending every Android Intent. An Android Package Name Value is a commonly used, together with an Android Class Name Value, to send an Explicit Intent, which uses an *Android Component* comprised of a Package Name and a Class name to specify the exact recipient application or service to which the intent will be delivered. **Intent Class** must also be specified to complete the definition of the *Android Component*.


Using an Explicit Intent can increase security and is often used when the intent being sent requires any sensitive data. Using an Implicit Intent provides enhanced flexibility since it may be sent to any application or service that has registered its ability to handle that intent and is often used when the intent being sent requires no sensitive data and when it may be desirable to dynamically control which application or service is ultimately invoked to handle the intent.

Enter a value that encodes one or more *Android Intent Flags* to be set for the Intent to be sent to invoke an application or service for a specified *Key* when activated in a specified *Keyboard State* and when the value ***Send Intent*** is selected for **Behavior Type**.


*Android Intent Flags* control how an Intent is handled by Android and/or by the application or service that receives the Intent. Further:


- Some *Android Intent Flags* are specific to the type of *Android Component* that will be invoked by the Intent (e.g. activity vs service).


- Whether certain *Android Intent Flags* are needed to invoke a desired function is up to that recipient and/or the definition of the intent that recipient is designed to consume.


- *Android Intent Flags* MUST be specified as a hexadecimal value with the appropriate bits set for any flag or flags desired.


- Consult the Android documentation to translate intent flag names, when needed, into their appropriate hexadecimal values.

Select whether the information about the *Key Event* should be attached to Intent to be sent to invoke an application or service for a specified *Key* when activated in a specified *Keyboard State* and when the value ***Send Intent*** is selected for **Behavior Type**.


Mapping is performed by responding to *Key Events* that indicate when a *Key* is being activated (pressed) or deactivated (released). When sending an Intent as the *Key Behavior* for a *Key*, the Intent can be sent when the *Key* is activated (pressed), deactivated (released), or both. When the same Intent is sent for both activation and deactivation, it may be important to the *Android Component* that is receiving and consuming the Intent to differentiate the two cases.


- If the value ***Attach*** is selected, the Android Intent sent will have the *Key Event* attached, allowing the consumer of the Intent to determine whether the Intent was sent as a result of the *Key* being activated (pressed) or deactivated (released).


- If the value ***Don't Attach*** is selected, the Android Intent sent will NOT have the *Key Event* attached, preventing the consumer of the Intent from determining whether the Intent was sent as a result of the *Key* being activated (pressed) or deactivated (released).

Enter the *Application Friendly Name* that identifies an application to be launched when the value ***Launch Application*** is selected for **Behavior Type**.


>Note that the *Application Friendly Name* is NOT the same as the *Android Package Name*. The *Application Friendly Name* is generally the name by which the application is identified in in-device UI. Launching an application by its *Application Friendly Name* is generally simpler and hence may be more convenient for an administrator than launching that application by its *Android Package Name*.


To launch an application by its *Application Friendly Name*, all the administrator needs to supply is that name. the *Application Friendly Name* is easily discoverable in-device in a variety of ways, including:


- The *Application Friendly Name* may be displayed in the Title Bar of the application's UI.


- The *Application Friendly Names* of recently launched applications are typically displayed in the Recent Applications panel.


- The *Application Friendly Name* is displayed in the AppInfo section of the Settings UI for an application.


To launch an application based on its *Android Package Name*, the value ***Send Intent*** should be selected for **Behavior Type** and much more information, including *Android Package Name*, which may be harder to discover, will need to be provided to send the right Intent to launch the application.

## Package Configuration



Use this *Array* to configure one or more Package(s)


Each *Android Package* of the given type will generally exhibit the same standard behaviors unless explicitly overridden by an Administrator. *Android Packages* of different types may exhibit different standard behaviors unless explicitly overridden by an Administrator.


This *Sub-array* allows an Administrator to identify *Android Packages*, by their *Android Package Names*, whose exhibited behavior should deviate from the standard behaviors that would otherwise apply based on their types. Any *Android Packages* whose *Android Package Names* are not specified in this *Sub-array* will exhibit the standard behaviors appropriate to their type.


The following high-level behaviors could be altered using this *Sub-array*.:


- *Allowed Services*


Zebra Android devices implement a variety of *System Services* that are generally available for use only by *Trusted Applications*. In some cases, there may be a need to grant such access to otherwise *Non-Trusted Applications*. In such cases, the Administrator can use *Allowed Services* to grant an application that he trusts, access to use one or more selected *System Services*.


- *Permissions*


Zebra Android devices have a variety of *System Permissions* that control access to *System APIs* that are generally available for use only by *Trusted Applications*. In some cases, there may be a need to grant such permissions to otherwise *Non-Trusted Applications*. In such cases, the Administrator can use *Permissions* to grant an application that he trusts, permission to use one or more *System APIs*.

Zebra Android devices have a variety of standard application behaviors that an Administrator might want to adjust. In such cases, the Administrator can use one or more of the following *Feature Variances* to specify which of the available deviations from behaviors to use for an application.


This *Sub-array* is used to provide a list of *Android Packages* for which deviations from standard behaviors will be configured.


- If this *Sub-array* has never been specified (never included in the *MCs* sent), then no configuration of deviation from standard behaviors will be made and hence all *Android Packages* will have standard behaviors.


- If this *Sub-array* is not specified (not included in the *MCs* sent), then no changes will be made to the configuration defined by any previously specified *Sub-array*.


- If this *Sub-array* is specified (included in the *MCs* sent), then the specified *Sub-array* will entirely replace the configuration defined by any previously specified *Sub-array*.


>Note that it is NOT possible to specify an "empty" *Sub-array* (with zero elements). Every *Sub-array* must contain at least one element. Any element(s) in this *Sub-array* where a blank (empty string) value is entered for **Package Name** will be ignored. It is therefore possible to specify a "virtually empty" *Sub-array* by entering a blank (empty string) value for **Package Name** in every element of the *Sub-array*.


- If this *Sub-array* is specified (included in the *MCs* sent), but that *Sub-array* is "virtually empty", as described above, then all deviation from standard behaviors previously configured by any previously specified *Sub-array* will be removed, thus returning all *Android Packages* to standard behaviors, returning to a state equivalent to when no *Sub-array* had ever been specified.

Use this *Sub-group* to configure Time Mode, Auto NTP Server Address, Auto NTP Drift Interval, Auto NTP Sync Interval, Time Zone Mode, Manual Time Zone, and Time Format


The following defined terms are important to understand:


>*GMT* (See *Greenwich Mean Time*)


>*Greenwich Mean Time*


*Greenwich Mean Time* refers to the *Local Time* at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, which matches and is used as the basis for *Coordinated Universal Time*.


>*UTC* (See *Coordinated Universal Time*)


>*Universal Time Coordinates* (See *Coordinated Universal Time*)


>*Coordinated Universal Time*


*Coordinated Universal Time* is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time and has a primary characteristic of being location independent. The time specified in *Coordinated Universal Time* is the same as *Greenwich Mean Time*.


>*Local Time*


*Local Time* refers to the agreed-upon time observed time at a location that has elected to operate as part of a *Time Zone*.


>*Time Zone*


*Time Zone* refers to a logical, and usually geographical, location where the *Local Time* observed may vary from the *Local Time* observed at other locations. *Time Zone* is also used to refer to the rules by which a *Local Time* to be observed at a location is computed based on *Coordinated Universal Time*. For example, *Local Time* might be computed using a fixed offset from *Coordinated Universal Time* and/or using a seasonable adjustment (e.g., *Daylight Saving*).


>*Daylight Saving*


*Daylight Saving* refers to a seasonable variation in the *Local Time* observed at a location that has elected to operate as part of a *Time Zone*. For example, *Local Time* might be adjusted forward by one hour during that portion of the year when days are longer.


>*NTP* (See *Network Time Protocol*)


>*Network Time Protocol*


*Network Time Protocol* refers to a communication protocol used to communicate to a *Time Server* to acquire the current time and date, typically used to synchronize the clock on a client to the clock on the *Time Server*.


>*Time Server*


*Time Server* refers to a server used as a trusted authority from which the current time and date can be acquired via some communication protocol, such as *NTP*
.

### Data Wipe Configuration

<span class="breadcrumbs">

<a href="#systemConfig">System Configuration</a>
</font>
</span> <br><br>


Use this *Sub-group* to configure Data Wipe Options and Bypass SUW on Enterprise Reset


Sometimes it may become necessary or desirable to Wipe some or all device data. To understand when and why it might be appropriate to Wipe device data, it is important to understand the different types of device data that could exist, and which could be Wiped.


- *Primary Storage*


*Primary Storage* is flash memory that is allocated to hold data, organized as files, that is produced and stored while the device is running. Every Zebra Android device has some form of *Primary Storage*. although the size and utilization of it may vary from device to device. This is where standard Android folders, such as /sdcard and /data are located. *Primary Storage* is the "workhorse" storage of the device and is frequently read, written, and updated during normal device operation. All data stored in *Primary Storage* is encrypted by the system using device unique keys.


- *Persistent Storage*


*Persistent Storage* is flash memory that is allocated to hold data, which may or may not be organized as files, that needs to be more Persistent than *Primary Storage*. Every Zebra Android device has some form of *Persistent Storage*. although the size and methods required to access it may vary from device to device. This is where the Zebra-proprietary folder /enterprise, on devices that have it, is located. *Persistent Storage* is commonly used to store applications, configuration, and data that collectively define a "known good state" to which a device can be returned by Wiping *Primary Storage* but preserving *Persistent Storage*. Data stored in *Persistent Storage* is not necessarily encrypted by the system.


- *Portable Storage*


*Portable Storage* is flash memory on a Removable Micro SD Card that is used to hold data, organized as files, that is physically removable from the device itself. Not every Zebra Android device supports *Portable Storage*, and among devices that do, the size(s) of cards supported may vary. *Portable Storage* may be used to import data into a device, export data from a device, share data amongst devices, etc. Over time, the types of data that can usefully be stored and accessed on *Portable Storage* has become more and more limited, and likely will be even more restricted in the future. Data stored in *Portable Storage* can optionally be encrypted. Any one Removable Micro SD Card can only be used for *Portable Storage* or *Adopted Storage* at any given time and switching between the two requires Wiping of all data from the card.


- *Adopted Storage*


*Adopted Storage* is flash memory on a Removable Micro SD Card that is used to extend *Primary Storage*. Even through the card is physically removable from the device, once adopted, it should not be removed since it can negatively impact the continuing operation of the device. Unlike *Portable Storage*, *Adopted Storage* CANNOT be used to import data into a device, export data from a device, share data amongst devices, etc. All data stored in *Adopted Storage* is encrypted in the same manner as the *Primary Storage* it extends. Wiping *Primary Storage* does NOT directly Wipe *Adopted Storage* but does render the data on the card unusable.


The following types of Data Wipe are supported:


- *Enterprise Reset*


*Enterprise Reset* causes *Primary Storage* to be Wiped, all data in *Adopted Storage* to be invalidated, and all data in *Persistent Storage* and *Portable Storage* to be preserved. When performing an *Enterprise Reset*, a flag is kept in *Persistent Storage* to indicate that it has been done. This flag is used to prevent repetition of *Enterprise Reset* from being performed if another request to Wipe *Primary Storage* is sent again after the *Enterprise Reset*. If another *Enterprise Reset* is later desired, the request to Wipe *Persistent Storage* must be removed, by removing the ***Primary Storage*** option. This will cause the flag to be removed and allow a subsequent *Enterprise Reset* to be performed once the ***Primary Storage*** is specified again. *Enterprise Reset* is typically used to return a device a previously stored "known good" state, based on applications, configurations, and data that were previously stored Persistently, and hence should be performed relatively infrequently.


- *Factory Reset*


*Factory Reset* is identical to *Enterprise Reset* with the exception that all data in *Persistent Storage* is also Wiped. Because *Persistent Storage* is also Wiped, the approach described above for storing a flag in *Persistent Storage* cannot be used to prevent repetition of *Factory Reset* from being performed if another request to Wipe *Primary Storage* is sent again after the *Factory Reset*. *Factory Reset* is typically used to forcibly terminate management of a device, either to enable repurposing of the device, to prepare for the device for servicing, etc. and hence should be performed very infrequently. When enrolling a device for management at a later time, following an earlier request to perform a *Factory Reset*, care should be taken to avoid resending the same options, since nothing will prevent *Factory Reset* from being performed again, if requested.


Notes:


- The data to be Wiped is requested by specifying one or more **Data Wipe Option Type**s within **Data Wipe Option Type** *Sub-groups* as elements of this *Sub-array*.


- Each **Data Wipe Option Type** specifies a specific storage area to be Wiped and the type of Wipe operation(s) to be performed is chosen to ensure that all requested data will be Wiped.


- In some cases, it may not be possible to Wipe one storage area without also Wiping another storage area.


- If the combination of storage areas requested to be Wiped cannot be performed without Wiping additional storage areas that are NOT requested, then NOTHING will be Wiped, since no data will be Wiped unless specifically requested. For example, if ONLY ***Persistent Storage*** is specified, then nothing will be Wiped since it is not possible to Wipe ***Persistent Storage*** without ALSO Wiping ***Primary Storage***. .

Use this *Sub-group* to configure Update Mode, UI Control, Update Over Cellular, OTA Options, File-Based Update Source, File-Based Update Options, Suppress Reboot, File-Based Update Local Path And Name, and Streaming


The following defined terms are important to understand:


>*Zebra LifeGuard*


*Zebra LifeGuard* refers to Zebra’s <a href="https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/lifeguard.html">LifeGuard<sup>TM</sup> for Android<sup>TM</sup></a> program that offers *OS Updates* for Zebra Android devices. Fore more information on the LifeGuard (LG) program, see the <a href="https#058;//techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/faq">LifeGuard FAQ</a>.


>*OS Update*


An *OS Update* is the process or act of patching or replacing the Operating System (OS) software image of a Zebra Android device. *OS Updates* supported by *Zebra LifeGuard* can include *OS Upgrades* and, in some cases, *OS Downgrades*.


>*OS Upgrade*


An *OS Upgrade* can provide security-only updates, maintenance releases (including features and fixes) and baseline and Android-version updates and generally changes the device to have a newer (higher) *OS Version*.


>*OS Downgrade*


An *OS Downgrade* can remove security-only updates or maintenance releases (including features and fixes) or return a device to an earlier baseline or Android-version and generally changes the device to have a older (lower) *OS Version*. In most cases, an *OS Downgrade* also initiates a mandatory Data Wipe of *Primary Storage* to ensure that data is not placed at risk by the removal of security fixes that were protecting the data prior to the *OS Downgrade*.


Note: OS Downgrades are supported ONLY when using the Pass-through XML command. Downgrades cannot be performed using managed configurations.


>*OS Version*


An *OS Version* is a string, also sometimes referred to as a Build ID, that uniquely identifies a particular Operating System (OS) software image for a Zebra Android device. A successful *OS Update* that applies a new software image will ALWAYS result in a change of the *OS Version* reported by the device.


>*Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server*


The *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server* is an Internet-hosted server that enables remote initiation of *OS Updates* on Internet-connected Zebra Android devices when using the ***Fully Automatic*** or ***EMM Controlled*** modes.


>*Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service*


The *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service* is a software component that is built-into Zebra Android devices and communicates with the *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server* to allow it to remotely initiate *OS Updates* on the device. Use of this service requires the service to be enabled and requires device network connectivity over which the *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server* on the Internet can be reached. Fore more information on the *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service*, see <a href="https#058;//techdocs.zebra.com/lifeguard/update/">Device Update</a>.


>*Zebra LifeGuard Update Files*


A *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* is a ZIP-format file released by Zebra. These files can be leveraged by the *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server* and the *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service* when performing ***Fully Automatic*** or ***EMM Controlled*** *OS Updates* or can be manually downloaded and used to perform ***File-Based Updates*** *OS Updates*.


>*Local Update Files*


A *Local Update File* is a *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* that is downloaded in advance, using any available means, stored in the Device File System and then used to initiate ***File-Based Updates***. Using *Zebra Local Update Files* can increase the reliability of *OS Updates* as well as allowing deferred initiation at a time when network connectivity may be unavailable, at the expense of occupying, at least temporarily, a potentially significant amount of Device File System space.


>*Streamed Update Files*


A *Streamed Update File* is a *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* that is downloaded on demand when ***File-Based Updates*** are initiated and never needs to be stored in the Device File System. Using *Streamed Update Files* avoids the need to have sufficient Device File System space to hold potentially large files to initiate *OS Updates*, but increases the risk that network connectivity loss during the *OS Update* could cause the *OS Update* to fail. The use of *Streamed Update Files* is only allowed for *Zebra LifeGuard Update Files* that support *A/B Mode* due to the risks associated with failures due to network connectivity loss.


>*A/B Mode*


*A/B Mode* is a mode wherein an *OS Update* can be performed by installing the new OS into the B partition while the device is running in the A partition. This allows the *OS Update* to be performed safely while the device is in use because the current OS being run from the A partition is not affected. When the *OS Update* is completed successfully, a device reboot is required to activate the new OS in the B partition. If the new OS is successfully activated, then the partitions are swapped so the next *OS Update* in *A/B Mode* will replace the prior OS. If the new OS cannot be successfully activated, the current OS will be retained, preventing any loss of operability. *A/B Mode* is sometimes also referred to as "Seamless Update" because the bulk of the processing can be performed in the background with minimal impact on User workflow. Sometime after the completion of an *OS Update* performed in *A/B Mode*, a reboot is required, but this reboot could be delayed until a time when it will little or no impact on User workflow.


>*Zebra StageNow*


*Zebra StageNow* is Zebra's Android device Staging (configuration and deployment) solution, which simplifies the local initiation of *OS Updates* in ***File-Based Updates*** mode.


>*Zebra Recovery Mode*


*Zebra Recovery Mode* is a special mode into which Zebra Android devices can be booted that enables a User to manually initiate *OS Updates* in ***File-Based Updates*** mode using *Local Update Files*. *Zebra Recovery Mode* is also used when *OS Updates* are remotely initiated using *Zebra LifeGuard Update Files* that DO NOT support *A/B Mode*. In such cases, the device will reboot into *Zebra Recovery Mode* when the *OS Update* is initiated, the *OS Update* will be performed in *Zebra Recovery Mode*, then the device will reboot into the new, updated, OS. .

Select how *OS Updates* will be initiated on the device.


- If the value ***Fully Automatic*** is selected, then *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service* will be enabled and configured to automatically update the device whenever a suitable new *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* is published by Zebra. Use of this mode requires device network connectivity over which the *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server* on the Internet can be reached. Standard data rates apply for metered connections.


- If the value ***EMM Controlled*** is selected, then *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service* will be enabled but configured to NOT automatically update the OS even if a suitable new OS is published by Zebra. A LifeGuard OTA-integrated EMM can be used to control when/if *OS Updates* are initiated remotely on devices and which *Zebra LifeGuard Update Files* are used. Use of this mode requires device network connectivity over which the EMM Server can be reached and over which *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Server* can be reached. Standard data rates apply for metered connections.


- If the value ***File-Based Updates*** is selected, then *Zebra LifeGuard OTA Service* will be disabled. **File-Based Update Options** can be specified to initiate *OS Updates* or *OS Updates* may be manually initiated on a device by the User using *Zebra StageNow* or *Zebra Recovery Mode*.

Select the Type of a single **File-Based Update Option** relating to how/when a *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* will be used to initiate an *OS Update*. when ***File-Based Updates*** is specified for **Update Mode**.


- If the value ***Reboot Count Unchanged*** is selected, then an *OS Update* will be initiated when the value is set if the device has not rebooted since this value was first set and if the other requisite values for File Update are also specified. This Option assumes that a reboot will be performed as result of any *OS Update* (successful or unsuccessful) and hence that once the device has been rebooted, there would be no value in repeating the *OS Update*.


- If the value ***Version Mismatch*** is selected, then an *OS Update* will be initiated when the value is set if the device reports a different *OS Version* for its current OS from that specified in **Mismatch Version** and if the other requisite values for File Update are also specified. This Option assumes that the administrator has properly determined the *OS Version* that will be present on the device once the *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* is applied and has accurately specified that *OS Version* value. The *OS Version* that will be present on the device once a *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* is applied to a device will be provided along with the *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* where it is posted by Zebra on the Internet. If an incorrect *OS Version* is specified, then it will likely never match the version reported by the device after performing the *OS Update* and could lead to repeated attempts to update the OS on the device.


Note: It is allowable to use any combination of **File-Based Update Options** together, in which case an *OS Update* will ONLY be performed if the conditions associated with ALL specified options are met.


Note: When using **File-Based Update Options** to perform an *OS Update* using a *Zebra LifeGuard Update File*, **File-Based Update Source** must also be specified to identify the Source from which the *Zebra LifeGuard Update File* will be acquired to perform the *OS Update*.


- If the value ***Local Update File*** is selected for **File-Based Update Source**, then **File-Based Update Local Path And Name** must also be specified to provide the path and file name of the *Local Update File*, which must already be present in the Device File System, to be used to perform the *OS Update*.

Select the Log Action to be performed.


- If the value ***Start Background Collection*** is selected, then the Log Management subsystem will Start Background Collection of Log Files. To ensure that Log File content required for troubleshooting is available, Background Collection of Log Files should be Started well before the occurrence of an event of interest to ensure that when the Log Files are acquired, they will contain information concerning that event.


- If the value ***Stop Background Collection*** is selected, then the Log Management subsystem will Stop Background Collection of Log Files. Since Background Collection of Log Files can consume significant system resources, it is best to Stop Background Collection of Log Files when troubleshooting is completed and collection of Log Files is no longer required.

- If the value ***Basic+TCP Dump*** is selected, then the Log Management subsystem will be configured to collect Kernel, Logcat and TCP Dump log data.


Since Background Collection of Log Files can consume significant system resources, it is best to select the minimum level of Logcat logging that will serve the need. When unsure, it may be advisable to start with lowest level and work up to higher levels if needed.

Enter the URI of a location on a Remote Server to which all Snapshot Files previously Created on-device, and which have not yet been Uploaded, will be Uploaded.


- Snapshot Files will be Uploaded to the Remote Server in the order they were Created on-device (oldest to newest).


- Each Snapshot File will be automatically deleted from the device once it has been successfully Uploaded to the Remote Server.


The specified URI MUST start with a *Protocol Specification* that indicates which file transfer protocol should be used to Upload the Snapshot File. The following are supported:


- FTP:// - The (insecure) File Transfer Protocol (FTP) protocol will be used to Upload the Snapshot File.


- FTPS:// - The (secure) File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS) protocol will be used to Upload the Snapshot File.


The specified URI:


- MAY contain authentication credentials that will be used to authenticate to the Remote Server before Uploading the Snapshot File.


- MUST contain an IP address or domain name that identifies the Remote Server to which the Snapshot File will be Uploaded.


- SHOULD typically contain path that identifies the location on the Remote Server, relative to the home folder of the default account or the account selected by the authentication credentials, to which the Snapshot File will be Uploaded.


- MUST NOT contain a file name since the name of the file to which the Snapshot File will be Uploaded on the Remote Server will be automatically generated, as described below, to ensure that Snapshot Files from various devices, and created at various times, do not overwrite each other.


Each Snapshot File that is Uploaded to the Remote Server will be assigned an automatically generated unique file name of the format:


- *model*-*serial*-*date*-*time*.zip.


The above format enables files Uploaded to the same folder on the Remote Server to be differentiated by the models and serial numbers of the devices that Uploaded them and by the date and time when the files were created on those devices.


- For example: **TC510K-17068522528997-01312020-132649.zip**


Within the above example:


- **TC510K** is the model identifier of the device that Uploaded the Snapshot File.


- **17068522528997** is the serial number of the device that Uploaded the Snapshot File.


- **01312020** is the date the Snapshot File was Created in the device, indicating January 31, 2020.


- **132649** is the time the Snapshot File was Created in the device, indicating 1:26:49 PM.

Select whether the device Display will be Allowed to automatically Blank (display nothing) on a device under certain conditions.


When a User is operating a motor vehicle with a vehicle-mounted device, it is often advisable, and sometimes mandatory, for safety or regulatory reasons, to prevent the User from interacting with the device or being distracted by the Display of the device, while the vehicle is in motion.


At present, this feature is supported ONLY on the Zebra VC80x vehicle-mounted Android device.


- If the value ***Never Blank*** is selected, the device Display will NOT be Allowed to automatically Blank (display nothing).


- If the value ***Blank When Triggered by Signal*** is selected, the device Display WILL be Allowed to automatically Blank (display nothing). The following must also be specified:


- **Signal** to specify the signal that will be used to activate automatic Display Blanking.


- **Polarity** to specify the polarity of the signal specified via **Signal** that will be used to activate automatic Blanking.


- **Debounce Delay** to specify the time that will be used to debounce the signal specified via **Signal**.

Select the Signal that will be used to trigger automatic Display Blanking when the value ***Blank When Triggered by Signal*** is selected for **Mode** to turn on *Display Blanking Mode*.
- If the value ***Input 1*** is selected, on the Zebra VC80x vehicle-mounted Android device the Clear To Send (CTS) input signal on Serial Port 1 will be used to trigger automatic Display Blanking.
- If the value ***Input 2*** is selected, on the Zebra VC80x vehicle-mounted Android device the Clear To Send (CTS) input signal on Serial Port 2 will be used to trigger automatic Display Blanking.


A common configuration to support *Display Blanking Mode* would be to connect the Request to Send (RTS) output signal of the selected Serial Port to the Clear To Send (CTS) input signal on the same serial port, via a switch, such as one activated by the vehicle accelerator. When the switch is activated, the output RTS output signal would be fed back into the CTS input signal and detected to trigger automatic Display Blanking.

Enter the Debounce Delay that will be used for the Signal that will be used to trigger automatic Display Blanking when the value ***Blank When Triggered by Signal*** is selected for **Mode** to turn on *Display Blanking Mode*.


The value specified should be in milliseconds and will be used as a delay following a change in signal state for changing the state of Display Blanking. This is useful to avoid spurious or repetitive changes in Display Blanking state as a result of bounce or chatter on the signal used to trigger automatic Display Blanking. The value specified should be in the range of 250 milliseconds (one quarter of a second) to 32767 milliseconds (more than 32 seconds), which should be adequate to handle most situations.


1 second (1000) is used as the default if no value is entered.

- If the value ***Blank screen when signal goes inactive (OFF)*** is selected, the automatic Display Blanking will occur when the specified signal is detected as going inactive (OFF). This choice would be used in specialized configurations where the signal to be used to trigger automatic Display Blanking has reverse polarity.
- If the value ***Blank screen when signal goes active (ON)*** is selected, , the automatic Display Blanking will occur when the specified signal is detected as going active (ON). This is the most common choice for the common configuration of connecting RTS and CTS via a switch.

A category value is NOT mandatory to specify for an Android Intent. But a category value is commonly used to help identify the purpose of an Android Intent. This can be especially when the application or service to be invoked supports many functions, in which case many action values may be used to identify those functions and it may be useful to categorize those functions. In some cases, the same action value might be supported in more than one category. You will need to consult the documentation or developer of a given application or service to determine whether a category value is needed and, if so, which value will invoke the desired behavior.

To use a different Subscription, a different SIM must be explicitly selected by specifying **SIM Card Slot**.


- If the value ***On*** is selected, the WWAN adapter WILL handle multiple SIM Cards in Dual SIM Dual Standby Mode, which means that two SIM Cards, if present, can be active at the same time. This can be beneficial if the Subscriptions for those SIMs have different performance, pricing, coverage, etc. The default behavior in Dual SIM Dual Standby Mode is for Incoming Voice Calls and Incoming Text Messages to be received using BOTH Subscriptions, Outgoing Voice Calls and Outgoing Text Messages to ask the User which Subscription to use, and Data Communications to use the Subscription for the primary SIM.
