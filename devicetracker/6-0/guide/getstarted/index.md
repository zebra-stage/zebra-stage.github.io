            Workflow automation allows administrators to automate the task which determines what devices are at risk of being lost and then flag them to be recovered. This avoids the need for site managers to constantly monitor the state of their fleet of devices to determine which are at risk of being lost and then manually flag them to be found. By setting system thresholds, Device Tracker continuously monitors the state of devices and automates the process. To enable workflow <a href="../config/#automation">automation</a>, specify the conditions and/or thresholds that need to be met for the device to automatically change state. If a device meets any one or a combination of the defined thresholds or conditions, Device Tracker automatically flags that device as lost so that it can be recovered quickly.

            Yes, <a href="../secondaryble">Secondary BLE</a> allows a device to be located if it is powered off or has reached critically low battery (5% or less battery remaining). Device location is detected based on secondary BLE beacons transmitted, powered by the remaining device battery. Secondary BLE beacons are transmited as long as the battery is not completely depleted. When a device reaches a crtical low battery state, in general secondary BLE beacons can be transmitted for at least a few days - there are multiple factors that can affect this, including battery charge cycles, battery age, operating temperature, etc. Secondary BLE is supported only on select hardware, see <a href="https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/device-tracker.html">device compatibility</a>.

            To optimize the use of Device Tracker, execute or enable the following features:  
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="../config/#manageaccesspoints">AP Friendly Name</a></b> - Ensure the AP location friendly name is easily understood by users to identify the AP location which the device is connected to, such as sporting goods, when finding a device. </li>
                <li><b><a href="../config/#devicetositeassignment">Device-to-Site Assignment</a></b> - Automatically assigns a device to a site based on the AP the device is connected to. This helps to automatically register new devices and avoids manual device registration. </li>
                <li><b>User Authentication</b> - There are 2 methods to authenticate users: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Device Tracker users </b>â€“ in Device Tracker, <a href="../config/#nonssouser">add manager and administrator users</a> to grant access to view the dashboard. Administrators can view data across all sites. Managers can view data specific to their assigned site. (Only managers and administrators need to be added.) </li>
                        <li><b>Single Sign On (SSO)</b> - SSO enables a single login credential to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites. An existing SSO service is required. To use SSO with Device Tracker, follow steps to <a href="../config/#singlesignonsso">activate and integrate SSO</a>. Then <a href="../config/#manageusers">add SSO users</a> to the allow list and designate the user as administrator or manager to grant permission to access the respective Device Tracker dashboard.   </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>User Accountability</b> - User accountability can be enforced, tracking the user checked into the device. This is accomplished by enabling <a href="../config/#checkincheckoutdevice">Checkin/checkout</a>, preventing the user from gaining access to the device until their unique user barcode is scanned, in effect assigning that particular user to the device as viewed in the dashboard. 
                <p>With <a href="../config/#singlesignonsso">SSO</a>, user accountability can be enforced to track the user logged into the	device by enabling <a href="../config/#checkincheckoutdevice">Checkin/checkout</a>. This prevents the user from gaining access to the device until their login is authenticated, in effect assigning that 	particular user to the device as viewed in the dashboard. </p></li>
                <li><b><a href="../config/#automation">Automation</a></b> - Workflow automation allows administrators to automate the task of determining which devices are at risk of being lost and flagging them to be recovered. This avoids the need for site managers to constantly monitor the state of their fleet of devices to determine which are at risk of being lost and then manually flag them to be found. By setting system thresholds, Device Tracker continuously monitors the state of devices and automates the process. To enable workflow automation, specify the conditions and/or thresholds that need to be met for the device to automatically change state. If a device meets any one or a combination of the defined thresholds or conditions, Device Tracker automatically flags that device as lost so that it can be recovered quickly. </li>
                <li><b><a href="../config/#lostdevicenearby">Lost Device Nearby</a></b> - Aids in device recovery by proactively sending alert notifications to a device when a lost device is detected within close proximity, giving the option to recover the device and return it to production. </li>
                <li><b><a href="../dashboard/#reports">Generate Reports</a></b> - Managers and administrators can generate historical data reports and view device events and utilization, providing actionable information to improve fleet usage and employee procedures. </li>

            Yes, <a href="../secondaryble">Secondary BLE</a> allows a device to be located if it is powered off or has reached critically low battery (5% or less battery remaining). Device location is detected based on secondary BLE beacons transmitted, powered by the remaining device battery. Secondary BLE beacons are transmited as long as the battery is not completely depleted. When a device reaches a crtical low battery state, in general secondary BLE beacons can be transmitted for at least a few days - there are multiple factors that can affect this, including battery charge cycles, battery age, operating temperature, etc. Secondary BLE is supported only on select hardware, see <a href="https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/device-tracker.html">device compatibility</a>.

2. _(Optional)_ Enable [Secondary BLE](../secondaryble/) to locate a device if it loses power.

### Configuration

1. [Create new user accounts](../config/#manageusers) based on role: [administrator](../config/#administratorrole) or [manager](../config/#managerrole). No user login is required for [end users/associates](../config/#userassociaterole).
   - Managers can be permitted to [modify device names or access points](../config/#registration).
2. If SSO is enforced, follow steps to [integrate SSO](../config/#singlesignonsso).
3. [Register sites](../config/#managesites) and [access points](../config/#manageaccesspoints).
4. [Register devices.](../config/#managedevices)
   - _(Optional)_ [Automatically assign devices to a site](../config/#devicetositeassignment) based on the connected AP.
5. _(Optional)_ Enable [Checkin/Checkout](../config/#checkincheckoutdevice) for user accountability.
6. _(Optional)_ Configure [Automation Thresholds](../config/#automation) for more efficient workflow.
7. _(Optional)_ Configure daily [Device Summary reports](../config/#endofdaydevicesummary) to be sent by email to select managers and administrators.
