<p>The dashboard provides a centralized to view of devices, access points (AP) and sites across an organization, with the ability to take action to track devices. It can be viewed through the web portal or the device client app, accessible by administrators and managers. Managers are granted access to data specific to their assigned site. Administrators are granted access to data across all sites in the organization and license information.</p>

<p>Device Tracker supports a single session for each user login and does not support multiple login sessions.&nbsp;If an admin or manager logs in to multiple browser sessions or devices using the same user login, the login sessions are automatically terminated after a period of time.</p>

<p>The web portal also provides data reports to administrators. Daily device summary reports can be sent to designated recipients.</p>

<h4 id="licensetransfer" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licensetransfer"><span></span></a>License Transfer</h4>

<p>Device Tracker supports the transfer of licenses from one device to another by returning the active license to the license pool and reallocating it to a new device. The active license can be released from the device by <a href="../use/#decommissionrecommissiondevice">decommissioning the device</a> or by <a href="../config/#deletedevices">deleting the device</a>. After the device is decommissioned or deleted, a message appears indicating the device it not licensed. To license the new device, after it communicates with the Device Tracker server it is allocated with the newly released license. The new license allocation is reflected in the License Summary.</p>

<h4 id="automaticlicenserenewal" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#automaticlicenserenewal"><span></span></a>Automatic License Renewal</h4>

<p>After reaching the expiration date, the license is automatically deallocated from the device and a message is displayed on the device indicating the license has expired. If any licenses are available, the Device Tracker server automatically allocates a license to the device for continued, uninterrupted operation. The newly allocated license is reflected in the License Summary.</p>

<h4 id="recommissiondevices" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#recommissiondevices"><span></span></a>Recommission Devices</h4>

<p>For devices being <a href="../use/#recommissionadevice">recommissioned</a> to place back into service as an active device, if a license is available, the server allocates a license to the device. After the device is licensed, Device Tracker is operational on the device and the allocated license is reflected in the License Summary. If a license is not available, the device remains in the decommissioned state and a <a href="../use/#addeditnote">note</a> is automatically added indicating there is no license available. This note overwrites any pre-existing note. When a license is available, the admin or manager must recommission the device to allocate the license and manually delete the note.</p>

<h4 id="licenseremoval" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licenseremoval"><span></span></a>License Removal</h4>

<p>Device Tracker licenses can be removed by <a href="../use/#decommissionrecommissiondevice">decommissioning the device</a> or by <a href="../config/#deletedevices">deleting the device</a> from Device Tracker. When a device is decommissioned or deleted, the license is automatically removed from the device, as reflected in the License Summary. Device Tracker is no longer operational on the device until it is relicensed.</p>

<h4 id="importantnotes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#importantnotes"><span></span></a>Important Notes</h4>

<p>Important information pertaining to Device Tracker licensing:</p>

<!--  // DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO INCLUDE ANYMORE
- The <a href="../dashboard/#licensesummary">Device Tracker web portal</a> provides the total license count. The <a href="../dashboard/#devicedashboard">device dashboard</a> provides the total number of devices being tracked. The difference between these two totals result to the number of devices that have no license.
-->

<ul>
<li><strong>License allocation and deallocation</strong> is based on enrollment to the Device Tracker server, regardless of the <a href="../dashboard/#devicedashboard">connection state</a> (disconnected or connected) seen from the device dashboard.</li>

<li><a href="../dashboard/#devicedashboard">Never Connected</a> devices are not licensed.</li>

<li>Due to a <strong>constraint from Google Firebase,</strong> an attempt to activate licenses on more than 5,000 devices within a span of 5 minutes can result in a denial of licenses to devices. <strong>Zebra strongly recommends limiting license activation to a maximum of 5,000 devices within 5 minutes.</strong> To circumvent Google’s constraint:


<ul>
<li>Device Tracker automatically synchronizes once every 4 hours to allocate licenses to devices.</li>

<li>Device Tracker administrators can manually trigger license synchronization by using the <strong>Sync Licenses</strong> button in the License Summary screen on the Device Tracker web portal.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>When <strong>allocating licenses to unlicensed devices,</strong> license allocation is based on license availabilty and the enroll time with the server. Methods for license allocation:

<p>Reports are provided in the web portal for administrators to monitor device performance, user activity and site activity. Administrators can designate managers or others to receive End of Day Device Summary reports by email.</p>

<p>All data reports are logged in America/Chicago time (CST). If multiple days are selected for the report, the report is provided in a single .ZIP file containing multiple .CSV files, one .CSV file per day. If the data report exceeds 1 GB in size for any day, the report is split into multiple files. Data history remains for up to 3 months.</p>

<h3 id="eventsbysite" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#eventsbysite"><span></span></a>Events By Site</h3>

<p><em>Events By Site</em> provides a report of event changes witihin a site based on the transition of device states (e.g. disconnected, found, not found, low battery, etc.) when moving from one state to another. A single date or date range may be selected for the report. The site report can be exported as a CSV file.</p>

<p>An event is a transition from one device state to another, regardless of the duration the device remains in the new state. The events for this report are based on the device finding process, device charging, low battery and connection state. The device count for the states are cumulative, incrementing each time a device reaches that state. Data is collected every day at 3 am America/Chicago time (CST) no matter which region the user is located. To view event and device details click on the link for the respective device count in the table.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Breakdown of <strong>automatic vs manual events</strong> based on device state - specifies whether the event was automatically (via <a href="../config/#automation">automation rules</a>) or manually triggered (e.g. user changes states during the finding process), categorized by device state transition</p></li>

<li><p>List of events based on how the device was flagged as <strong>To Be Found</strong> or <strong>Found.</strong> This provides insight into the events that led to the device state.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Average time -</strong> average time elapsed across all devices based on one of the following device states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Be Found -</strong> duration of time while the device is in the <strong>To Be Found</strong> state</li>
