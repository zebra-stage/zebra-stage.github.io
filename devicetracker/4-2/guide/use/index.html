<p>When using Device Tracker, the end user is initially presented with the <a href="#devicecheckout">Check-out</a> screen if the <a href="../config/#configuredevicecheckout">Check-out feature</a> is enabled. Once an administrator or manager logs in after check-out, they gain access to <a href="#monitordevices">monitor devices</a> across their organization (administrator) or site (manager) to identify devices at-risk.</p>

<p>To initiate the process to find a device, the misplaced device must be <a href="#markdevicetofind">marked for retrieval</a> by the administrator or manager. To <a href="#finddevice">find a device</a>, the “finding” device (the device performing the search) is used to determine the distance the user is located in relation to the “misplaced” device (the device to be found) using the visual proximity meter. Once a device is found, <a href="#decommissionrecommissiondevice">recommission the device</a> to place it back into the active device pool. Alternatively, <a href="#decommissionrecommissiondevice">decommission the device</a> if it needs to be removed from the active device pool.</p>

<p>A <a href="#addeditnote">note</a> can be added at any time to capture comments specific to the device (e.g. device screen damaged) to aid in tracking or identifying problems with the device. This feature is available only for administrators and managers.</p>

<p>For operation, device <a href="#licenses">licenses</a> are required.</p>

<p>The <a href="../setup/#requirements">Requirements</a> must be met to find a device.</p>

<!--
This section discusses the actions that can be taken to track devices:

- **[Device Check-out](#devicecheckout) -** an optional feature enforcing users to scan their user barcode to gain access to the device and associate the user to the device for accountability.
- **[Find Devices](#finddevices) -** provides the procedure to find a device, even if the device has lost power (for devices with secondary BLE).
- **[Decommission/Recommission Device](#decommissionrecommissiondevice) -** remove or reinstate a device from the active pool of devices. Easily track devices that need to be removed from the pool due to repair or decommission.
- **[Add/Edit a Note](#addeditnote) -** add device-specific comments, e.g. to identify device issues.

<h2 id="devicecheckout" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#devicecheckout"><span></span></a>Device Check-out</h2>

<p><a href="../config/#configuredevicecheckout">Device Check-out</a> is an optional feature that can be enabled by the administrator. If enabled, the user is required to scan their barcode at the start of their work shift to check-out the device, then logout at the end of their work shift to check-in the device. The check-out screen is in kiosk mode, preventing the user from accessing the device until check-out is performed. When a device is checked-out, the user is associated with the particular device until the user checks in the device.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Android Q and higher, if "Display over other apps" permission is not granted, the user must manually launch the app once and grant this permission for check-out functionality to work properly.</p>

<h3 id="checkout" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#checkout"><span></span></a>Check-out</h3>

<p>Perform a device check-out at the start of a work shift as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remove the device from power to automatically display the check-out screen or launch the app on the device.</p></li>

<li><p>The check-out screen appears, prompting to scan a barcode. When in the check-out screen, the user is prevented access to the device until check-out is performed.
<img style="height:350px" src="checkout.png"><i>Device check-out</i></p></li>

<li><p>Scan the barcode associated with the user by pressing the scan trigger or tapping on the barcode image on the screen. If the administrator has set a prefix string in the <a href="../config/#enablecheckoutcheckin">barcode prefix option</a>, the barcode must contain the prefix specified for check-out to be successful.</p></li>

<li><p>A message appears indicating the user is checked-out successfully. The app is placed in the background.</p></li>

<li><p>The user is now associated with the device. <br></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Check-out is enabled, after a device is rebooted the Check-out screen may take up to one minute to be displayed.
<br><br></p>

<h3 id="checkin" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#checkin"><span></span></a>Check-In</h3>

<p>Choose one of the following options to Check-In a device:</p>

<p><b>Option 1:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the app.</li>

<li>Tap on the options menu from the top right and select Check-In Device.</li>

<li>The user is checked-in. The check-out screen appears prompting to scan a barcode.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Option 2:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Connect the device to power.</li>

<li>The user is checked-in. The check-out screen appears prompting to scan a barcode.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Option 3:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Reboot the device.</li>

<li>The check-out screen appears prompting to scan a barcode.</li>
</ol>

<p>When initiating the process to find a device, the misplaced device must first be set to the <strong>To Be Found</strong> state by the administrator or manager. The finding device, or the device performing the search, is used to determine the distance the user is located in relation to the “misplaced” device, or the device to be found. Location must be enabled on the finding device to perform the device search.</p>

<p>A device must be marked <strong>To Be Found</strong> before a device search can take place.</p>

<p>To mark a device "To Be Found":</p>

<ol>
<li>From the device list, tap and hold the device card of the misplaced device to find. Select <strong>Set To Find.</strong>
<img style="height:350px" src="device-action-menu.png">

</ol>

<h2 id="finddevice" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#finddevice"><span></span></a>Find Device</h2>

<p>A device search is initiated from the <strong>To Be Found</strong> device list. For an associate, the <strong>To Be Found</strong> device list is displayed after starting the client app. For an administrator or manager, the <strong>To Be Found</strong> device list is accessible via the dashboard.</p>

<p>When the user is ready to take action to perform the device search, the first step is to use the finding device to find the access point (AP) that the misplaced device is connected to. This provides the general location of the misplaced device. The user walks toward the AP, then uses the Bluetooth proximity indicator on the finding device to identify how close or far the misplaced device is located in relation to the finding device. To further pinpoint the device location, a sound can be played by tapping the <strong>Play Sound</strong> button on the finding device to locate the misplaced device by audio sound. <strong>Play Sound</strong> is also useful if the proximity indicator is not operational (e.g. Bluetooth is disabled).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Do Not Disturb (DND)</strong> must be turned off in Android on the misplaced device for the device to play a sound so it can be retrieved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To start the search process:</strong></p>

<p>Perform <em>one</em> of the following in the <strong>To Be Found</strong> device list:<br>Tap and hold the device card for the misplaced device. Select <strong>Start Finding</strong> from the device action menu. <br>

<li>The device tracking screen appears. The device state is changed to <strong>Being Found.</strong></li>

<li>Check the <strong>Connected AP</strong> on the tracking screen on the misplaced device. Walk towards the known location of the AP.</li>

<li>Using the BLE proximity meter, walk towards the misplaced device. The BLE proximity meter identifies the overall trend on how far or how close the user is located in relation to the misplaced device. The closer the misplaced, the further the blue indicator bar expands to the right. As the finding device approaches the misplaced device, the numerical value on the meter decreases as it reaches “Close” or “0” value.
<img style="height:350px" src="device-tracking.png"><i>Tracking screen with proximity meter</i></li>

<li>Tap <strong>Play Sound</strong> on the finding device. The misplaced device emits a chirping sound to help identify its location. Walk towards the sound. Continue this step until the device is found.</li>

<li>If the misplaced device is found, tap <strong>Device found.</strong> The device is then moved to the Found state. If the device is not found, <strong>tap Cannot find.</strong> The device is then moved to the <strong>Cannot Find</strong> state. The device is listed under the corresponding categories accessible from the dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>When a device is found, <a href="#decommissionrecommissiondevice">recommission</a> the device to place it back into the active device pool. Alternatively, decommission the device if it needs to be removed from the active device pool.</p>

<p>A <a href="#addeditnote">note</a> can be added at any time to capture comments specific to the device to aid in tracking or identifying problems with the device. This feature is available only for administrators and managers.</p>

<p><strong>Behavior when locating a misplaced device in different scenarios:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If Bluetooth is turned off on a misplaced device that is powered-on and a user initiates locating  that device, Device Tracker automatically turns on Bluetooth in the misplaced device to allow that device to be located using the proximity indicator. However, if the misplaced device is disconnected from the server, Bluetooth will not be turned on.</li>

<li>If Bluetooth is turned off on the misplaced device while it is being found, that device cannot be located using the proximity indicator. However, if the device is powered off, it can still be located using secondary BLE (if supported).</li>

<li>A device is in the <strong>Disconnected</strong> state when it does not communicate with the server for approximately 12 minutes. During this time, if a device search is performed on a misplaced device that has lost connection with the server, that device cannot be located using the proximity indicator and any attempt to <strong>Play Sound</strong> is ineffective since audio cannot be emitted from the disconnected device.</li>

<li>If a finding device initiates a device search prior to the misplaced device becoming <strong>Disconnected</strong>, the misplaced device can be found using the proximity indicator.</li>

<li>If Bluetooth is turned off on the finding device while it is locating the misplaced device, the misplaced device cannot be located using the proximity indicator on that finding device. </li>

<li>If Android Location Services is turned off on the finding device, it cannot locate the misplaced device using the proximity indicator. <!-- The **Play Sound** feature is available to locate the misplaced device.--></li>
</ol>

<!--
1. If Bluetooth is turned off on a misplaced device that is powered-on, note the following:
   - While finding a misplaced device, the proximity indicator cannot be used to locate that device since the Bluetooth beacons are not emitted.
   - When a user initiates locating a misplaced device, Bluetooth is automatically turned on (in the misplaced device) to allow the proximity indicator to be used to locate the misplaced device. However, if the misplaced device is disconnected from the server, Bluetooth will not be turned on.
   - When the misplaced device is being located, that device cannot be found using the proximity indicator. However, if the misplaced device is powered off, it can still be located using secondary BLE.
2. If Bluetooth is turned off on the finding device while it is locating the misplaced device, the misplaced device cannot be located using the proximity indicator.
3. If Android Location services is turned off on the finding device, it cannot locate the misplaced device using the proximity indicator. The **Play Sound** feature can be used instead.
4. A device is in the **Disconnected** state if it does not communicate with the server for approximately 12 minutes. If a device search is performed and audio is attempted to play during this time frame, audio cannot be emitted from the misplaced device.
-->

<!-- If the misplaced device is powered off during a device search, while powering on the misplaced device, the proximity indicator cannot be used until the misplaced device completes the boot process. Since the secondary BLE is inoperable when the device is powered on, locating a device in this scenario relies on the primary BLE beacon. Note: Secondary BLE is operable only when the device is powered off.-->

<!--

<p><b>Usage Notes:</b></p>


- A device is in the <b>Disconnected</b> state if it does not communicate with the server for approximately 12 minutes. If a device search is performed and audio is attempted to play during this time frame, audio cannot be emitted from the misplaced device.
- If the device being found is powered off during a device search, while powering it on again proximity cannot be detected until the device completes the boot process. Since the secondary BLE is inoperative when the device is powered on, device locationing relies on the primary BLE beacon.
- While finding a device, if Bluetooth is turned off on the device being found, the proximity meter cannot be used to locate the device since the Bluetooth beacons are not emitted.

<h3 id="secondaryble" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#secondaryble"><span></span></a>Secondary BLE</h3>

<p>For devices with <a href="../secondaryble">secondary BLE</a> beaconing capability, Device Tracker can locate the device if it loses battery power or is powered off. The location of the device is detected by signals transmitted from the secondary BLE beacon. Attempts to locate the device must occur soon after the device loses power, prior to loss of power from the secondary BLE beacon. The secondary BLE radio of some devices is located in the battery. Such devices are subject to the behavior described in <a href="/mx/beaconmgr/#batterybasedblebehavior">battery-based BLE behavior</a>.</p>

<p>When locating a device based on its secondary BLE beacon, the <strong>Play Sound</strong> feature is disabled during device search since it cannot function due to the loss of device power. The <a href="../use/#devicedetails">Secondary BLE state</a> is viewed from the <strong>Device Details</strong> screen.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Secondary BLE differs from the built-in device <em>primary</em> BLE used for device tracking, which cannot operate once the device loses power.</li>

<li>While finding a device, the values seen in the BLE proximity indicator may differ when finding a device that is powered on (primary BLE) versus a device that is powered off (secondary BLE), particularly if the <a href="../setup/#secondarybleconfiguration">Reference RSSI</a> is not specified for the battery-based secondary BLE. This is due to varying location and orientation of the secondary BLE antenna. During the finding process, the user should rely on the trend reflected in the BLE proximity meter to navigate to the misplaced device.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disablefinding" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#disablefinding"><span></span></a>Disable Finding</h2>

<h2 id="licenses" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licenses"><span></span></a>Licenses</h2>

<p><a href="../license">Licenses</a> are required for Device Tracker operation on devices. Licenses are shared from a single pool of licenses, regardless of expiration date. When a device registers to the Device Tracker server, if a license available, it is allocated to the device from the license pool.</p>

<p>After a license expires or when a device is <a href="../use/#recommissionadevice">recommissioned</a>, it is automatically allocated a license if available. Administrators can perform the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor licenses.</li>

<li>Transfer a license from one device to another.</li>

<li>Remove a license.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="../license">License</a> section for more information.</p>

<p>To view license information:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the web portal, tap <strong>License Summary</strong> in the left menu.</li>

<li>The following information is provided based on unexpired licenses:


<ul>
<li><strong>Total licenses -</strong> quantity of licenses that have been purchased


<ul>
<li><strong>Total licenses available -</strong> quantity of licenses that are available and can be allocated to devices</li>

<li><strong>Total licenses consumed -</strong> quantity of licenses allocated to devices</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>List of licenses purchased</strong> with corresponding quantity and expiration date. This data is static and removed from the list after the expiration date is surpassed.</li>

<li><strong>Sync Licenses</strong> button to refresh license data on-demand and synchronize with the Zebra Enterprise Software Licensing system. The license information is updated once each day.</li>

<li><strong>Time stamp</strong> of the last occurrence when the license information was synchronized with the license server.</li></ul>
</li>
