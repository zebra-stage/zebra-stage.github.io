## Overview

For initial setup, the administrator must register device, access point (AP) and site information, and configure Device Tracker. Alternatively, after initial setup additional devices and APs can be registered. Setup and configuration of Device Tracker can be performed as follows:

- **[Register access points](#siteaccesspointanddevicedata) -** Register the access point location to identify which AP the device is connected to and to aid in locating the device.
  - **Assign a friendly name to the access point -** helps users identify the physical location of the AP in the site
  - **Assign site location –** helps users identify which site the AP belongs in
- **[Register devices](#siteaccesspointanddevicedata) -** Register device information to identify the devices.
  - **Assign a device friendly name -** helps users identify the device
  - **Assign a site location -** identifies the physical location of the device
- **[Enable/Disable secondary BLE beacon](#secondaryble) -** Allow devices with a secondary BLE beacon to be located when the device loses power.
- **[Enable/Disable device check-out](#devicecheckout) –** _Optional:_ Administrators toggle the check-out feature in the web portal, enforcing users to scan their user barcode at the beginning of their work shift to check-out their device. This associates the device to the particular user.
    - **[Add/Modify barcode prefix](#devicecheckout) -** Specify a prefix for the barcode scanned during check-out. This adds the restriction to only accept scanned barcodes that begin with the specified prefix.

Administrators have access to the [web portal](#webportal) to:
  - Add/Delete administrators
  - Add/Delete site managers
  - Reset passwords
  - Enable/Disable check-out

For the convenience of administrators, logging can be captured for diagnostic purposes, as detailed in the [Diagnostics](#diagnostics) section.

## Site, Access Point and Device Data

Administrators register site names, access points, and device information with friendly names to aid in identifying, tracking and locating devices. Sample AP and device CSV files are supplied by Zebra for the administrator to populate with the appropriate data. Copy the populated CSV files to the mobile device for the data to be imported through the client app. Importing data either modifies or adds entries to the existing database, unless deleting a device. The data fields are:

<table class="facelift" style="width:100%" border="1" padding="5px">

<br>
The device data fields are required in the device .CSV file whether adding or deleting devices. In each .CSV file, keep the header information intact and replace the sample data with the appropriate data desired. It is particularly important for the AP location friendly name to be easily understood for users to determine the location within the facility when finding a device. Special characters, such as '.', '#', '$', '[', or ']', are not supported. The .CSV file cannot be UTF-8 encoded, otherwise an error can occur; it must be saved in a normal comma separated values format.<br><br>
Sample Import AP .CSV file content:
<pre class="prettify">
    <code>
        SiteName,BSSID,AssetName,LocationFriendlyName

## Secondary BLE

For devices with secondary BLE beaconing capability, Device Tracker can locate the device if it loses power due to critically low battery or is manually powered off. Locationing is based on signals transmitted from the secondary BLE beacon. Attempts to locate the device must occur soon after the device loses power, prior to loss of power of the secondary BLE beacon. In this circumstance, the **Play Sound** feature is disabled during device search since it cannot function due to the loss of device power.

<p>See <a href="../setup/#secondarybleprofile">Secondary BLE Profile</a> to enable the secondary BLE beacon.</p>

The <a href="../mgmt/#devicedetails">Secondary BLE state</a> is viewed from the **Device Details** screen.

### Device Check-out

Device check-out is an _optional_ feature that maintains user accountability and traces device use. When enabled, a unique barcode is required for each user to scan at the start of their work shift. User operation in the check-out screen is limited to only scanning barcodes. The check-out screen is in kiosk mode, preventing the user from accessing the device until check-out is performed.

- **Check-out:** At the start of a work shift, the user checks-out the device by scanning their unique barcode. This associates the user with the device, as seen in the device card and device details screen.
- **Check-in:** At the end of a work shift, the user checks-in the device by placing it on a powered cradle or logging out through the top-right menu from the main device screen. After check-in, the user is no longer associated with the device.
<br>
<p>The check-out/check-in feature displays an overlay on top of the screen to enforce the user to scan their unique barcode, maintaining user accountability of the device. If any other app also uses a screen overlay, the check-out/check-in feature may conflict with the other app. For example, this feature cannot be used with Zebra’s MotionWorks Proximity application.</p>

**Enable device check-out:**

1. From the web portal, tap **Settings** in the left menu.
2. Toggle **Checkin/Checkout** to enable the feature.
<p>If enabled, Checkout appears as a device state in the administrator and manager dashboard listing the devices that are checked-out.</p>

#### Set Check-out Barcode Prefix

When check-out is enabled, by default no prefix is defined allowing all barcodes to be accepted. The administrator can configure a prefix in the form of a character string, adding a restriction to accept only barcodes that begin with the specified prefix. If a barcode scanned does not contain the prefix, check-out is not successful.
<br>
When generating a barcode with the prefix, the specified prefix is followed by the username identifier. The following is a sample barcode containing prefix “NGDTRK-” and username “JohnDoe”:
<img style="height:80px" src="barcode-prefix.png"/>
_Sample barcode with prefix and username: "NGDTRK-JohnDoe"_
<br>

**To set the barcode prefix:**

1. **Enable Checkin/Checkout the web portal.** This exposes the Prefix field in the Application Configuration screen.
2. **Enter the desired text for the prefix.** If all barcodes should be accepted with no prefix, keep the entry blank.
   <br>
   Only barcodes that begin with the specified prefix can initiate the checkout.

## Diagnostics

For diagnostic purposes, logging can be enabled in Device Tracker to capture application and system information to Android logcat. [RxLogger](/rxlogger) is a built-in tool on Zebra Android devices that collects data and event logs from logcat and stores them in a single location. If issues are encountered, a Zebra representative may request for the log files to be collected and supplied. There are 2 methods to capture logging: StageNow or EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) system.

### StageNow

To use StageNow to capture logging:

1. Open StageNow on the device.
2. Scan the barcode to enable Device Tracker logging and start RxLogger log capture:
   <img style="height:150px" src="start-rxlogger.png"/>

3. Reproduce the issue.
4. Scan the barcode to disable Device Tracker logging and stop RxLogger log capture:
   <img style="height:150px" src="stop-rxlogger.png"/>

<p>Logs are located in the RxLogger folder (default location: /sdcard/RxLogger).</p>
<br>

### EMM

To use EMM to capture logging, refer to the following XML content:

- To enable logging:

        <wap-provisioningdoc>
            <characteristic version="1.0" type="com.zebra.devicetracker">
                <parm name="EnableLog" value="1" />
            </characteristic>
        </wap-provisioningdoc>

- To disable logging:

        <wap-provisioningdoc>
            <characteristic version="1.0" type="com.zebra.devicetracker">
                <parm name="EnableLog" value="0" />
            </characteristic>
        </wap-provisioningdoc>

Send the desired XML content to the EMM using either [OEMConfig](/oemconfig) or [MX](/mx/overview) to configure the app.
