## Overview

Enterprise Keyboard builds on the stock Android keyboard to provide a more effective means of inputting data into Zebra devices. The Zebra keyboard permits quick switching between languages, can to scan directly from the keyboard to collect data, and can set keys to perform specific tasks. It also implements finger-flicks for typing long-press characters and swiping to switch key layouts. 

Enterprise Keyboard uses Android's Personal dictionary feature for spelling suggestions and corrections, giving it the ability to store industry-specific terms to help improve speed and accuracy of keyboard input. <!--Terms can saved and mass-deployed using Zebra's Mobility Extensions (MX) and [StageNow](/stagenow/2-2/about/) tools. -->

### Text Correction
Text Correction controls automatic corrections to typed text based the predefined parameters explained below. In addition, the Personal dictionary feature allows a list of custom or industry-specific terms to be stored and presented as spelling suggestions along with those of the selected language(s).

<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="pref_text_2.png"/>
<br>

##### Set preferences as desired: 

<b>Block offensive words</b> prevents display of spelling suggestions that might be deemed offensive or insensitive as determined by external standards of decency.

<b>Auto-correction</b> automatically replaces misspelled words with those found in the Add-on and Personal dictionaries (see below). Replacements are executed by pressing the spacebar. 

<b>Show correction suggestions</b> displays suggested words while typing but does not replace them when the spacebar is pressed unless Auto-correction is also enabled.

<b>Personalized suggestions</b> learns from communications and typed data to improve suggestions.

<b>Suggest Contact names</b> automatically displays contacts from the contact list when typing names. 

<b>Next-word suggestions</b> looks at the word prior to the one being typed and displays words that might come next.

#### Personal dictionary
The Personal dictionary can be used to store terms specific to a particular industry to help improve the speed and accuracy of input from the keyboard. For example, if configured for a medical device, typing "gerd" might present the phrase "gastroesophageal reflux disease" and similar medical terms that begin with the same letters. 

<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="pref_text_1.png"/>
<br>

<b>Notes</b>:

* Terms must be added to the Personal dictionary one at a time. 
* There is no set limit on the length of terms and phrases that can be entered into the Personal dictionary.
* Longer terms and phrases may be injected with an ellipsis (...) when displayed. 
* Spelling suggestions do not appear with all field types.  
<!-- * For mass deployment, the Personal dictionary must be populated beforehand using Zebra's [StageNow](/stagenow/2-2/about/) tool (not available in EKB 1.0).-->

#####Add a term to the Personal dictionary: 

&#49;. <b>Tap "Personal dictionary"</b> in the Text correction Preference panel:

No further actions are permitted.

### Remapping Keys
Enterprise Keyboard designates five keys as user-programmable: one in the alpha-key layout and four in the numerical layout. The Remapping panel shows the current character and Unicode mappings for each key. The images below show default settings, including the Alpha P1 key mapped to display the EMOJI panel. 

One key can be remapped in the alpha-key layout:
