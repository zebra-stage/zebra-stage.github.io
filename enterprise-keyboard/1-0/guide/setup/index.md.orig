## Overview
The Zebra Enterprise Keyboard is delivered as part of the operating system on Zebra Android Lollipop devices and installed as an OS patch on some KitKat devices. Depending on the device, activation might be required to make Enterprise Keyboard available to users. Zebra's keyboard also can be set as the default input method, if desired. This section covers manual activation of Enterprise Keyboard and the steps for setting it as the default input device. For advanced settings, please see the [Customize section](../settings). 

Enterprise Keyboard 1.0 is activated and configured locally at the device, as described in this guide. 

<!-- In future versions, Enterprise Keyboard will be configurable: 

* Manually at the device
* Programmatically through [EMDK for Android](/emdk-for-android/4-0/guide/about) development tools 
* Remotely:
    * Using [StageNow](/stagenow/2-2/about/) and the [UI Manager](/mx/uimgr/) service 
    * Through a company's own mobile device management (MDM) system (if supported by that system) 
-->

1. <b>Open Language and input</b> 
2. Add a check for <b>"Enterprise Keyboard"</b> to enable it on the device

4. <b>Select a language</b> (if other than the system default)

Please refer to the respective tool of choice for more information. -->

## Deactivation

Enterprise Keyboard cannot be removed if it was included with the device operating system. However, it can be deactivated by reversing the activation process described in the Activation section. The steps below describe how to deactivate Enterprise Keyboard using the Android Settings panel. 

<b>Warning: This action renders Enterprise Keyboard inaccessible, including its scanning and other capabilities</b>. 

### Manual Deactivation

#####Deactivate Enterprise Keyboard on a device: 

&#49;. <b>Open the Settings panel</b> on the device:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="home_screen.png"/>
<br>

&#50;. Scroll to and <b>tap the "Language and input" control</b>:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="input_in_settings.png"/>
<br>

&#51;. <b>Remove the check next to "Enterprise Keyboard"</b> to disable it on the device. If the Android keyboard is the only other input device, it automatically becomes the default input device and cannot be disabled. 
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="panel_default.png"/>
<br> 


Manual deactivation of Enterprise Keyboard is complete. 

<!--
### Automated Deactivation
Later versions of Enterprise Keyboard (after v1.0) will offer the ability to be deactivated on multiple managed devices using an organization's own MDM server in the same way as other Android apps. Alternatively, remote unstallation can be accomplished through Zebra's [EMDK](/emdk-for-android/4-0/guide/about) or [StageNow](/stagenow/2-2/about/) tools using the [App Manager](/mx/#app-manager) service.
