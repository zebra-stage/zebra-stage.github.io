## Overview

The dashboard provides a centralized to view of devices, access points (AP) and sites across an organization, with the ability to take action to track devices. It can be viewed through the web portal or the device client app, accessible by administrators and managers. Managers are granted access to data specific to their assigned site. Administrators are granted access to data across all sites in the organization and license information.

Device Guardian supports a single session for each user login and does not support multiple login sessions. If an admin or manager logs in to multiple browser sessions or devices using the same user login, the login sessions are automatically terminated after a period of time.

The web portal also provides data reports to administrators. Daily device summary reports can be sent to designated recipients.

### Welcome Dashboard

#### Productivity

The Productivity dashboard presents a graphical representation of the number of devices lost and found, the average duration devices remain lost and the average recovery time for devices. This information is available at both company-wide and individual site levels. These graphs provide a quick overview of Device Guardian's effectiveness, the speed of device recovery and the quantity of lost devices successfully located, especially when contrasting the metrics of a single site against those at a company-wide level.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> Administrators _must_ select the site from the **Site** dropdown for the site data to be displayed in the graphs.

<img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="productivity-dashboard-admin.jpg" />

The graphs are presented based on the site and duration period selected. The options for the duration period are:

- **Weekly -** displays data from the past 6 weeks on a weekly basis, up until the day before the current date. Each data point signifies a distinct week within this timeframe.
- **Monthly -** displays data from the past 6 months on a monthly basis, up until the day before the current date. Each data point signifies a distinct month within this timeframe.

The first two graphs illustrate the trends of lost and found devices at both the overall company level and individual site level. This enables a comparison of a site's performance in relation to the average across the entire company.

The last two graphs display the trends of the average duration devices remain lost versus the average duration to locate a device. The left graph illustrates the average durations from a company-wide level and the right graph displays the average durations from an individual site level. A device is deemed lost from the moment it is marked "To Be Found" until it changes to a different state (e.g. Found or Not Found). The duration to find a device commences from the moment ["Start Finding"](../use/#finddevice) is selected until the device is actually found.

### Licenses

Device Guardian uses the floating license model - licenses are shared among devices from a combined license pool regardless of expiration date. If a license is available, the Device Guardian server allocates a license to the device. When a license is no longer needed, the license is released from the device and returned to the license pool to make available to other devices. Licenses are monitored from **License Summary.**

After a license expires or when a device is [recommissioned](../use/#recommissionadevice), it is automatically allocated a license if available. Administrators can perform the following:

- Monitor licenses.
- Transfer a license from one device to another.
- Remove a license.

To procure licenses, see the [License](../license) section.

---

#### View Licenses

To view license information:

1.  From the administrator dashboard, tap **License Summary** in the left menu under **Dashboard**.
2.  Two types of licenses are displayed: **Mobile Device** and **Accessory** (such as [Bluetooth scanners](../config/#bluetoothscanners)). The following information is provided for each based on unexpired licenses:

    - **Total licenses -** total number of licenses that have been purchased
      - **Total licenses available -** number of licenses that are available and can be allocated to devices
      - **Total licenses consumed -** number of licenses allocated to devices
    - **List of licenses** shows the License Count and Expiration Date of current licenses. This data is static and removed from the list after the expiration date is surpassed.
    - **Sync Licenses** button refreshes license data on-demand and synchronizes with the Zebra Enterprise Software Licensing system. The license information is updated once each day. The time stamp displayed beside this button indicates the date and time when the license data last synchronized from the licensing server to the web portal.
    - **Release Licenses -** applies to Accessory Licenses. This option allows the administrator to release, or decommision, the license for specific accessory devices. To release a license from an accessory device:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Create a .CSV file containing a header row with column names, followed by data rows listing the model number and serial number for each of your devices. For example:<br />

            ModelNumber,SerialNumber
            RS61B0-KBSSZWR,S123456789

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Click **Release Licenses** from License Summary.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Drag the .CSV file or select the file to upload. Click **Import.**<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. A message appears indicating the import was successful.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Click **Sync Licenses.** The number of **Available** licenses is incremented and the number of **Consumed** licenses is decremented.

<img alt="image" style="height:550px" src="../license/license.png"/>

_License Summary in web portal_

---

#### License Transfer

Device Guardian supports the transfer of licenses from one device to another by returning the active license to the license pool and reallocating it to a new device. The active license can be released from the device by [decommissioning the device](../use/#decommissionrecommissiondevice) or by [deleting the device](../config/#deletedevices). After the device is decommissioned or deleted, a message appears indicating the device it not licensed. To license the new device, after it communicates with the Device Guardian server it is allocated with the newly released license. The new license allocation is reflected in the License Summary.

---

#### Automatic License Renewal

After reaching the expiration date, the license is automatically deallocated from the device and a message is displayed on the device indicating the license has expired. If any licenses are available, the Device Guardian server automatically allocates a license to the device for continued, uninterrupted operation. The newly allocated license is reflected in the License Summary.

---

#### Recommission Devices

<p>For devices being <a href="../use/#recommissionadevice">recommissioned</a> to place back into service as an active device, if a license is available, the server allocates a license to the device. After the device is licensed, Device Guardian is operational on the device and the allocated license is reflected in the License Summary. If a license is not available, the device remains in the decommissioned state and a <a  href="../use/#addeditnote">note</a> is automatically added indicating there is no license available. This note overwrites any pre-existing note. When a license is available, the admin or manager must recommission the device to allocate the license and manually delete the note.</p>

---

#### License Removal

Device Guardian licenses can be removed by [decommissioning the device](../use/#decommissionrecommissiondevice) or by [deleting the device](../config/#deletedevices) from Device Guardian. When a device is decommissioned or deleted, the license is automatically removed from the device, as reflected in the License Summary. Device Guardian is no longer operational on the device until it is relicensed.

---

#### Important Notes

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> Important information pertaining to Device Guardian licensing:

- **License allocation and deallocation** is based on enrollment to the Device Guardian server, regardless of the <a href="../dashboard/#devicedashboard">connection state</a> (disconnected or connected) seen from the device dashboard.
- [Never Connected](../dashboard/#devicedashboard) devices are not licensed.
- Due to a **constraint from Google Firebase,** an attempt to activate licenses on more than 5,000 devices within a span of 5 minutes can result in a denial of licenses to devices. **Zebra strongly recommends limiting license activation to a maximum of 5,000 devices within 5 minutes.** To circumvent Google’s constraint:
  - Device Guardian automatically synchronizes once every 4 hours to allocate licenses to devices.
  - Device Guardian administrators can manually trigger license synchronization by using the **Sync Licenses** button in the License Summary screen on the Device Guardian web portal.
- When **allocating licenses to unlicensed devices,** license allocation is based on license availabilty and the enroll time with the server. Methods for license allocation:
  - Device Guardian automatically synchronizes once every 4 hours to allocate licenses to devices.
  - Device Guardian administrators can manually trigger license synchronization by using the **Sync Licenses** button in the License Summary screen on the Device Guardian web portal.

### Productivity

The Productivity dashboard presents a graphical representation of the number of devices lost and found, the average duration devices remain lost and the average recovery time for devices. This information is available at both company-wide and individual site levels. These graphs provide a quick overview of Device Guardian's effectiveness, the speed of device recovery and the quantity of lost devices successfully located, especially when contrasting the metrics of a single site against those at a company-wide level.

Managers view data pertaining to their assigned site in comparison to data from the entire company.

<img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="productivity-dashboard-mgr.jpg" />

The graphs are presented based on a selected duration period:

- **Weekly -** displays data from the past 6 weeks on a weekly basis, up until the day before the current date. Each data point signifies a distinct week within this timeframe.
- **Monthly -** displays data from the past 6 months on a monthly basis, up until the day before the current date. Each data point signifies a distinct month within this timeframe.

The top two graphs illustrate the trends of lost and found devices at both the overall company level and individual site level. This enables a comparison of a site's performance in relation to the average across the entire company.

The bottom two graphs display the trends of the average duration devices remain lost versus the average duration to locate a device. The left graph illustrates the average durations from a company-wide level and the right graph displays the average durations from an individual site level. A device is deemed lost from the moment it is marked "To Be Found" until it changes to a different state (e.g. Found or Not Found). The duration to find a device commences from the moment ["Start Finding"](../use/#finddevice) is selected until the device is actually found.

### Device/Site Search

Two types of searches can be performed:

1. Search by site
2. Search by device

---

#### Search By Site

Administrators can search for a site in the site list. A site search performs a partial search for the characters entered in the search field. The search results display matches that include the characters being searched for within the site name.<br>

To perform a site search:

From the administrator's site list, enter the site to search in the search field. The results are displayed.
    <img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="site-search.png"/>

#### Search by Device

A device search returns a list of devices that match the keyword entered based on the criteria selected: device friendly name, device model, serial number, or AP friendly name. The search result is limited to display 100 records. If this limit is exceeded, a message is displayed below the device list indicating that there are additional records and the search should be refined to avoid exceeding the limit.

## Reports

Reports are provided in the web portal for administrators to monitor device performance, user activity and site activity. Administrators can designate managers or others to receive End of Day Device Summary reports by email.

All data reports are logged in America/Chicago time (CST). If multiple days are selected for the report, the report is provided in a single .ZIP file containing multiple .CSV files, one .CSV file per day. If the data report exceeds 1 GB in size for any day, the report is split into multiple files. Data history remains for up to 3 months.

---

### Events By Site

_Events By Site_ provides a report of event changes within a site based on the transition of device states (e.g. disconnected, found, not found, low battery, etc.) when moving from one state to another. A single date or date range may be selected for the report. The site report can be exported as a CSV file. Administrators can view data based on site location or display data across all sites. Managers can view data based on their assigned site.

An event is a transition from one device state to another, regardless of the duration the device remains in the new state. The events for this report are based on the device finding process, device charging, low battery and connection state. The device count for the states are cumulative, incrementing each time a device reaches that state. Data is collected each day at 3 am based on the local site time zone.

### End of Day Device Summary

_End of Day Device Summary_ provides a snapshot of device counts based on their state at that moment in time (e.g. disconnected, found, not found, low battery, etc.). The data is _not_ cumulative (aside from the Connected Accessories total count). This summary report helps to identify and track the accountability of devices at the end of the day on a daily basis. From the web portal, administrators can display data based on site location or display data across all sites.

_End of Day Device Summary_ reports can be sent by email to administrators, managers or other users. The following options are configured either [manually or through .CSV file import](../config/#managesites): email subscription, scheduled report time, email recipients, report option (based on device states), and option to include email attachments. The report is emailed daily at the predefined report time and is sent from email address `zdtrksupport@zebra.com` to the listed email recipients. The email contains a summary list showing the count of devices meeting each selected reporting option. Following this summary list are separate tables providing details on each device. If email attachments are enabled in the report settings, individual .CSV files containing device data are attached to the email per the selected report option. Each site can be configured with different scheduled report times. Data is not available for the current date until the scheduled report time elapses.
