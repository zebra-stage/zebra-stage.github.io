<!--
Device Guardian can block user access to the device with either of the following optional features for [device checkout](../config/#checkincheckoutdevice):

- [User barcode scan](../config/#checkincheckoutdevice) - If enabled, the end user is presented with the [Checkout](#devicecheckout) screen, prompting the user to scan their user barcode to gain device access.
- [SSO signin](../config/#singlesignonsso) - If enabled, the user logs in with their SSO credentials to gain access to the device.
-->

<p>Device Guardian and Device Guardian Access Management operation and functionality are based on the <a href="../config/#overview">user role</a> of the user logged in.</p>

<p>There are two methods for locating devices:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Method -</strong> This standard feature, available on all devices, uses the integrated Bluetooth radio to emit BLE beacons when the device is enrolled with the Device Guardian server and marked as lost, provided it is not in low battery or powered off. It leverages access point location, a Bluetooth-based visual proximity indicator, and a sound alert feature for effective tracking.</li>

<li><strong>Secondary Method -</strong> An optional feature for select devices equipped with a <a href="../secondaryble/">secondary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</a> battery option. This enables the secondary BLE beacon in the battery pack to activate when the host device is in low battery or powered off, allowing for tracking for a limited time even when the battery is depleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>To <a href="#finddevice">find a device</a> using the primary method, the missing device must be <a href="#markdevicetofind">marked for retrieval</a> by the administrator or manager. The “finding” device (the device performing the search) is used to determine the distance the user is located in relation to the “missing” device (the device to be found) using the visual proximity meter.

<h2 id="lostdevicenearby" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#lostdevicenearby"><span></span></a>Lost Device Nearby</h2>

<p><a href="../config/#lostdevicenearby">Lost Device Nearby</a> is an optional feature (configured by the administrator) that proactively sends alert notifications to a device when a lost device is detected within close proximity. This allows the lost device to be found by nearby users in addition to any users that may be actively searching for the device. The nearby user that receives the alert notification can promptly initiate the finding process, expediting device recovery by allowing the lost device to be found more quickly with its vicinity immediately known. Alerts are sent as one or a combination of the following: audio, vibration, LED, and/or Android notification.</p>

<p>When the notification message appears on the detecting device, it includes the device model and device name of the lost device. Tap on the notification to start the finding process. If there are multiple lost devices detected nearby, a notification is received from each lost device. If the detecting device is online (internet is available), the Device Guardian <a href="../dashboard/#devicedetails">Device Details</a> screen appears and the user can start the finding process by tapping the <strong>Start Finding</strong> button. The user proceeds to find the lost device with the <a href="../use/#finddevice">proximity indicator</a> and play sound features.</p>

<p><img alt="image" style="height:400px" src="lost-device-notification.png"></p>

<p><em>Notifications of lost devices nearby</em></p>

<p>Alert notifications are received even if the detecting device is <em>offline</em>, as seen in the notification message which displays "offline" status for the detecting device. In this case, tap on the notification to immediately start the finding process. The Device Guardian app appears for the user to find the lost device with the <a href="../use/#finddevice">proximity indicator</a>. The detecting device cannot mark the lost device as "Found" until the detecting device is back online. However, this can be done in the web portal by the manager or administrator.</p>

<!--
<img alt="image" style="height:350px" src="lost-device-nearby-offline.png"/>

_Notification received when detecting device is offline_
-->

<p>When <em>Lost Device Nearby</em> is enabled, the <strong>Mobile Device</strong> screen displays a <strong>Nearby</strong> tab, which filters missing devices that are marked "To Be Found" and are receiving Bluetooth beacons while within nearby proximity.</p>

<p><img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="lost-device-nearby.png"></p>

<p><em>Missing Devices Detected Nearby</em></p>

<p>When the detecting device is offline (no internet connectivity), nearby devices can still be detected from the BLE beacons received. The nearby device is displayed as "Unknown" along with its beacon ID.</p>

<p>The detecting device receives <em>Lost Device Nearby</em> notifications when all the following requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The device must be in the "In Service" state.</li>

<li>The device must neither be charging nor in a low battery state (based on the <a href="../config/#configureautomationsettings">Low battery threshold</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Lost Device Nearby</em> notifications are cleared if Bluetooth beacons from the lost device are no longer detected for at least 5 minutes. This occurs when any one of the following conditions are met for the lost device:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is no longer located within close proximity of the detecting device.</li>

<li>It has stopped emitting Bluetooth beacons.</li>

<li>It is no longer in the Missing (To Be Found) state.</li>
</ul>

</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Pinpoint location:</strong> To further narrow down the device’s location, tap <strong>Play Sound</strong> on the finding device and listen for the audio alert from the missing device. Walk towards the sound to locate the device.</p></li>

<li><p>If the missing device is found, tap <strong>Found.</strong> Select <em>one</em> of the following based on the behavior encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The device is changed to the <strong>Found</strong> state if no automation rules are configured.</p></li>

<li><p>If <a href="../config/#automation">Automation</a> rules are configured with option <strong>Automatically Mark Devices "To Be Found"</strong> enabled, a message appears prompting the user to take action based on the rule(s) selected and to check each checkbox after action is taken. <em><strong>It is important to execute ALL actions specified,</strong> otherwise the device will return back to the <strong>Missing (To Be Found)</strong> state after it is marked <strong>Found</strong> based on the automation process.</em> After all action is taken and all checkboxes are checked, tap <strong>Confirm.</strong> The device state is changed to <strong>Found</strong> if automation option <strong>Automatically place device "In Service" when marked "Found"</strong> is disabled.

<img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="device-found-action.png"></p>

<p><i>Sample screen of action to take after device is found</i></p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>If the device is found and the automation option <strong>Automatically Place Device "In Service" When Marked "Found"</strong> is disabled, manually recommission the device to place it back into the active device pool. Alternatively, decommission the device if it needs to be removed from the active device pool.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the device is not located during the search process, the user can tap the back button to exit the session, changing the device state from "Being Found" to "To Be Found (Missing)."</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>By default, the Pixie Dust tone is used when the audio alert is played on the device.</li>

<li><strong>Play Sound</strong> is also useful if the proximity meter is not operational (e.g. Bluetooth is disabled). Audio alerts can be played during the search process even if the lost device is in <a href="#donotdisturbdndmode">Do Not Disturb (DND) mode</a>, with exceptions.</li>

<li>Device Guardian can locate devices even when if they lose battery power or are turned off, provided the device has a <a href="#secondaryble">secondary BLE</a>.</li>

<li>Administrators and managers can add <a href="#addeditnote">notes</a> to capture comments specific to the device, such as hardware damage or reasons for decommissioning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behavior when locating a missing device in different scenarios:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If Bluetooth is turned off on a missing device that is powered-on and a user initiates locating that device,</strong> Device Guardian automatically turns on Bluetooth in the missing device to allow that device to be located using the proximity indicator. However, if the missing device is disconnected from the server, Bluetooth will not be turned on.</li>

<li><strong>If Bluetooth is turned off on the missing device while it is being found,</strong> that device cannot be located using the proximity indicator. However, if the device is powered off, it can still be located using secondary BLE (if supported).</li>

<li><strong>A device is in the <em>Disconnected</em> state when it does not communicate with the server for approximately 12 minutes</strong>. During this time, if a device search is performed on a missing device that has lost connection with the server, that device cannot be located using the proximity indicator and any attempt to <strong>Play Sound</strong> is ineffective since audio cannot be emitted from the disconnected device.</li>

<li><strong>If a finding device initiates a device search prior to the missing device becoming <em>Disconnected,</em></strong> the missing device can be found using the proximity indicator.</li>

<li><strong>If Bluetooth is turned off on the finding device while it is locating the missing device,</strong> the missing device cannot be located using the proximity indicator on that finding device.</li>

<li><strong>If Android Location Services is turned off on the finding device,</strong> it cannot locate the missing device using the proximity indicator.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3 id="secondaryble" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#secondaryble"><span></span></a>Secondary BLE</h3>

<p>For devices with <a href="../secondaryble">secondary BLE</a> beaconing capability, Device Guardian can locate the device if it loses battery power or is powered off. The location of the device is detected by signals transmitted from the secondary BLE beacon. Attempts to locate the device must occur soon after the device loses power, prior to loss of power from the secondary BLE beacon. The secondary BLE radio of some devices is located in the battery. Such devices are subject to the behavior described in <a href="/mx/beaconmgr/#batterybasedblebehavior">battery-based BLE behavior</a>.</p>

<p>When locating a device based on its secondary BLE beacon, the <strong>Play Sound</strong> feature is disabled during device search since it cannot function due to the loss of device power. The <a href="../use/#devicedetails">Secondary BLE state</a> is viewed from the <strong>Device Details</strong> screen.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Secondary BLE differs from the built-in device <em>primary</em> BLE used for device tracking, which cannot operate once the device loses power.</li>

<li>While finding a device, the values seen in the BLE proximity indicator may differ when finding a device that is powered on (primary BLE) versus a device that is powered off (secondary BLE), particularly if the <a href="../secondaryble/#configuration">Reference RSSI</a> is not specified for the battery-based secondary BLE. This is due to varying location and orientation of the secondary BLE antenna. During the finding process, the user should rely on the trend reflected in the BLE proximity meter to navigate to the missing device.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting Default Notification Sound -</strong> Go to <strong>Android Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Default notification sound</strong> and select <strong>Silent</strong> to mute notifications without enabling DND mode.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exceptionstodeviceguardianaudioalerts" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#exceptionstodeviceguardianaudioalerts"><span></span></a>Exceptions to Device Guardian Audio Alerts</h4>

<p>Device Guardian plays audio alerts when DND mode is enabled through the methods above, <strong>except</strong> in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Total Silence -</strong> If the device is set to <strong>Total silence</strong> via Quick Settings.</li>

<li><strong>Silent Notification Sound -</strong> If the Default notification sound is set to <strong>Silent</strong> through Android Settings.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recommendationstoensurefullfunctionality" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#recommendationstoensurefullfunctionality"><span></span></a>Recommendations to Ensure Full Functionality</h4>

<p>To maintain full functionality of Device Guardian, Zebra recommends restricting user access to prevent complete silencing of the device:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disable Quick Settings Access -</strong> Use an EMM or <a href="/mx/uimgr/">Zebra MX UI Manager</a> to control the DND feature and restrict access to the DND UI in Quick Settings.</li>

<li><strong>Restrict Settings Access -</strong> Use an EMM or <a href="/ehs">Zebra Enterprise Home Screen</a> to limit access to Android Settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures help ensure that Device Guardian can perform audio alerts effectively, even when DND mode is enabled.</p>

## Decommission/Recommission Device

Decommission a device to remove it from the active device pool and recommission it to place it back into the active device pool.

### Recommission a Device  // REMOVED FROM DG 1.0

Recommission a device after it is found or when it is previously **Decommissioned** and needs to be placed back into the active device pool (e.g. returned from repair). Recommissioning a device restarts the device status reporting to the server and can only be performed by an administrator.

When recommissioning a device, if a license is available it is automatically allocated to the device. If no license is available, the device remains in the decommissioned state and a <a href="./#addeditnote">note</a> is automatically added indicating there is no license available. This note overwrites any pre-existing note. When a license is available, the admin or manager must recommission the device to allocate the license and manually delete the note.


<p>Steps to recommission a device (administrator access required):</p>


1. From the device list, tap and hold on the device card to be recommissioned and tap **Recommission** from the popup menu.
    <img alt="image" style="height:400px" src="recommission.png"/>
2. The **Status** is changed to **In Service,** as seen in the **Device Details** screen.

<h2 id="decommissiondevice" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#decommissiondevice"><span></span></a>Decommission Device</h2>

<p>When a device is no longer in use or needs to be removed from the active device pool, mark it as <strong>Decommissioned</strong> to prevent any further reporting to the server. This applies to situations when the device is being sent for repair, the device is being replaced, or the device is deprecated and needs to be removed. When a device is decommissioned, the license is automatically deallocated from the device and returned to the license pool for it to be reallocated to another device.</p>

<p><em>If a device is decommissioned by a manager,</em> the device is removed from the assigned site and therefore no longer visible in the <a href="../dashboard/#managerdashboard">manager dashboard</a>. The device can be recommissioned only by an administrator.</p>

<p>To decommission a device (admin/manager access required):</p>

<ol>
<li>From the device list, tap and hold on the device card. Tap <strong>Decommission</strong> from the popup menu.
<img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="decommission.png"></li>

<li>The status is changed to <strong>Decommissioned</strong> and the user is prompted to enter a note.</li>

<li>If desired, add a note by entering text in the Note section to indicate the reason for the device decommission; see <a href="..#addeditnote">Add/Edit Note</a>.</li>

<li>Tap back. The note is saved and the device is placed in the <strong>Decommissioned</strong> category in the dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="addeditnote" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#addeditnote"><span></span></a>Add/Edit Note</h2>

<p>Administrators and managers can add a note to capture comments specific to the device to help in device tracking or identifying device problems. For example, a comment could be "device screen damaged".</p>

<p>To add or edit a note:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the device list, tap and hold the device card and tap <strong>Add a Note.</strong> If a note already exists, the option is provided to <strong>Edit a Note.</strong>
<img alt="image" style="height:400px" src="note-add.png"></li>

<li>The <strong>Note</strong> section appears in the <strong>Device Details</strong> screen prompting to enter in text.
<img alt="image" style="height:400px" src="note.png"><i>Enter a note or comment</i></li>

<li>After entering text for the note, tap the back button.</li>

<li>The note is saved and can be viewed in the <strong>Device Details</strong> screen.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notificationbehavior" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#notificationbehavior"><span></span></a>Notification Behavior</h2>

<p>Device Guardian notifications differ significantly between Android versions prior to 14 and versions 14 and above due to changes in the Android platform.</p>

<h3 id="androidversionspriorto14" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#androidversionspriorto14"><span></span></a>Android Versions Prior to 14</h3>

<p>For Android versions prior to 14, users cannot dismiss notifications triggered by the Device Guardian app, including those received upon successful installation and enrollment.</p>

<h3 id="androidversions14andhigher" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#androidversions14andhigher"><span></span></a>Android Versions 14 and Higher</h3>

<p>Android 14 introduces updates to notification behavior, enabling users to manually dismiss Device Guardian notifications from the device's notification drawer, especially in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can dismiss foreground notifications that were previously non-dismissible.</li>

<li>Notifications received after successful installation and enrollment of the Device Guardian app can be dismissed.</li>

<li>Notifications that appear upon device reboot or when a new event is triggered can be dismissed.</li>
</ul>
