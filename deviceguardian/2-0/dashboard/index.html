<p>The web portal dashboard provides a centralized to view of devices, access points (AP) and sites across an organization, with the ability to take action to track devices. It can be viewed through the web portal or the device client app, accessible by administrators and managers. Managers are granted access to data specific to their assigned site. Administrators are granted access to data across all sites in the organization and license information.</p>

<p>Device Guardian supports a single session for each user login and does not support multiple login sessions.&nbsp;If an admin or manager logs in to multiple browser sessions or devices using the same user login, the login sessions are automatically terminated after a period of time.</p>

<p>The web portal also provides data reports to administrators. Daily device summary reports can be sent to designated recipients.</p>

</h2><h3 id="licenses" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licenses"><span></span></a>Licenses</h3>

<p>Device Guardian uses the floating license model - licenses are shared among devices from a combined license pool regardless of expiration date. If a license is available, the Device Guardian server allocates a license to the device. When a license is no longer needed, the license is released from the device and returned to the license pool to make available to other devices. Licenses are monitored from <strong>License Summary.</strong></p>

<p>After a license expires or when a device is recommissioned, it is automatically allocated a license if available. Administrators can perform the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor licenses.</li>

<li>Transfer a license from one device to another.</li>

<li>Remove a license.</li>
</ul>

<p>To procure licenses, see the <a href="../license">License</a> section.</p>

<h4 id="licensetransfer" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licensetransfer"><span></span></a>License Transfer</h4>

<p>Device Guardian supports the transfer of licenses from one device to another by returning the active license to the license pool and reallocating it to a new device. The active license can be released from the device by <a href="../use/#decommissiondevice">decommissioning the device</a> or by <a href="../config/#deletedevices">deleting the device</a>. After the device is decommissioned or deleted, a message appears indicating the device it not licensed. To license the new device, after it communicates with the Device Guardian server it is allocated with the newly released license. The new license allocation is reflected in the License Summary.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="automaticlicenserenewal" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#automaticlicenserenewal"><span></span></a>Automatic License Renewal</h4>

<p>After reaching the expiration date, the license is automatically deallocated from the device and a message is displayed on the device indicating the license has expired. If any licenses are available, the Device Guardian server automatically allocates a license to the device for continued, uninterrupted operation. The newly allocated license is reflected in the License Summary.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="recommissiondevices" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#recommissiondevices"><span></span></a>Recommission Devices</h4>

<p>For devices being recommissioned to place back into service as an active device, if a license is available, the server allocates a license to the device. After the device is licensed, Device Guardian is operational on the device and the allocated license is reflected in the License Summary. If a license is not available, the device remains in the decommissioned state and a <a href="../use/#addeditnote">note</a> is automatically added indicating there is no license available. This note overwrites any pre-existing note. When a license is available, the admin or manager must recommission the device to allocate the license and manually delete the note.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="licenseremoval" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#licenseremoval"><span></span></a>License Removal</h4>

<p>Device Guardian licenses can be removed by <a href="../use/#decommissiondevice">decommissioning the device</a> or by <a href="../config/#deletedevices">deleting the device</a> from Device Guardian. When a device is decommissioned or deleted, the license is automatically removed from the device, as reflected in the License Summary. Device Guardian is no longer operational on the device until it is relicensed.</p>

<h4 id="importantnotes" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#importantnotes"><span></span></a>Important Notes</h4>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#FFA500;"></i> Important information pertaining to Device Guardian licensing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>License allocation and deallocation</strong> is based on enrollment to the Device Guardian server, regardless of the <a href="../dashboard/#devicedashboard">connection state</a> (disconnected or connected) seen from the device dashboard.</li>

<li><a href="../dashboard/#devicedashboard">Never Connected</a> devices are not licensed.</li>

<li>Due to a <strong>constraint from Google Firebase,</strong> an attempt to activate licenses on more than 5,000 devices within a span of 5 minutes can result in a denial of licenses to devices. <strong>Zebra strongly recommends limiting license activation to a maximum of 5,000 devices within 5 minutes.</strong> To circumvent Google’s constraint:


<ul>
<li>Device Guardian automatically synchronizes once every 4 hours to allocate licenses to devices.</li>

<li>Device Guardian administrators can manually trigger license synchronization by using the <strong>Sync Licenses</strong> button in the License Summary screen on the Device Guardian web portal.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>When <strong>allocating licenses to unlicensed devices,</strong> license allocation is based on license availabilty and the enroll time with the server. Methods for license allocation:

### Device Information

Administrators and managers have additional capability to view data:

- **Site List –** administrator access only; lists the sites in the organization
- **Dashboard –** administrator and manager access; lists a summary showing metrics based on Device Guardian and device status

* **Device List –** administrator and manager access; lists devices with capability to view device details<br>

Administrator or manager login is required to access the data.

#### Site List

After administrator login, a site listing is visible for site selection:

- **All Devices –** when selected, displays the dashboard of all devices (whether assigned or not assigned to a site) across all sites
- **Unassigned Devices –** when selected, displays the dashboard of devices that are not assigned to a site.
- **Sites -** lists all the sites across the entire organization. Select an individual site to display the dashboard for the particular site.
  <br>

<i>Site list</i>


---

#### Dashboard

The dashboard is accessible to administrators and managers, displaying device categories based on device status, along with statistics for each category. For administrators, the dashboard can be displayed for any site selected in the site list, including All Devices (across all sites) or Unassigned Devices. For managers, the dashboard displays information based on the site their device is assigned to. If the manager device is not assigned to a particular site, the dashboard displays information based on all unassigned devices.


<p>Dashboard categories:</p>


- **Total Devices –** displays the total number of devices being tracked within the particular site. If **All Devices** is selected instead of a particular site, the total number of devices reflects the devices across all sites. If **Unassigned Devices** is selected, the total number of devices reflects the devices that are not assigned to any site. <br>

Device status:

- **To Be Found –** filters devices designated To Be Found where action has not been taken to initiate the search for these devices.
- **Being Found –** filters devices that are actively being searched. Triggered when a user initiates a device search.
- **Found –** filters devices that were successfully found after a search. Triggered when a user indicates the device is found.
- **Cannot Find –** filters devices that could not be found after a search was conducted.
- **Decommissioned –** filters devices that are designated as decommissioned. These devices are not in the active device pool, the collection of devices with active server communication.
- **Unlicensed -** the device is not allocated with a license, therefore the app will not operate.
<br>

<p>Device battery states:</p>


- **Low Battery –** filters devices that have reached the low power threshold of 15% remaining battery or lower, requiring attention to be charged prior to battery depletion.
- **Charging –** filters devices that are powered on and in the charging state.
- **Discharging –** filters devices that are powered on and discharging.
  <br>


<p>Device connection states:</p>


- **Never Connected –** filters devices that are registered but never connected to the server.
- **Disconnected –** filters devices that have connected to the server but are no longer connected due to no communication with the server for approximately 12 minutes.
  <br>

<img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="admin-mgr-missing.png" />
<i>Dashboard</i>
<br>

**Note:** In split-screen mode, when the dashboard is displayed in Device Guardian and the app is not in focus, the app displays a blank screen. When Device Guardian is back in focus, the dashboard is displayed as expected.
<br>

#### Device List

The device list displays all devices corresponding to the selected category in the dashboard. In the dashboard screen, select a category in the list to view the corresponding list of devices. The search result is limited to display 100 records. If this limit is exceeded, a message is displayed below the device list indicating that there are additional records and the search should be refined to avoid exceeding the limit.

Each individual device is displayed as a “device card” that shows information pertaining to that particular device:

- Device friendly name (if not available, the device model and serial number is displayed)
- Device model and serial number
- AP friendly name (if available) or BSSID - **Never Connected** is displayed if device has never connected to the server. The icon indicates the connectivity state to the access point. A Wi-Fi icon with a slash indicates the device is not connected to the AP.
- Device status:
  - **In Service –** device is part of the active device pool and not in any of the other device states
  - **To Be Found –** the administrator or manager tagged the device, waiting for a user to take action to find the device
  - **Finding –** the device search is initiated by another user
  - **Found –** the device is located after conducting the search
  - **Cannot Find –** the device could not be found after the search was conducted
  - **Decommissioned –** device is removed from the active device pool
  - **Unlicensed -** the device is not allocated with a license, therefore the app will not operate.

* Top right icon indicates device battery level or charging state.

<p><em>End of Day Device Summary</em> provides a snapshot of device counts based on their state at that moment in time (e.g. disconnected, found, not found, low battery, etc.). The data is <em>not</em> cumulative (aside from the Connected Accessories total count). This summary report helps to identify and track the accountability of devices at the end of the day on a daily basis. From the web portal, administrators can display data based on site location or display data across all sites.</p>

<p><em>End of Day Device Summary</em> reports can be sent by email to administrators, managers or other users. The following options are configured either <a href="../config/#managesites">manually or through .CSV file import</a>: email subscription, scheduled report time, email recipients, report option (based on device states), and option to include email attachments. The report is emailed daily at the predefined report time and is sent from email address <code>zdtrksupport@zebra.com</code> to the listed email recipients. The email contains a summary list showing the count of devices meeting each selected reporting option. Following this summary list are separate tables providing details on each device. If email attachments are enabled in the report settings, individual .CSV files containing device data are attached to the email per the selected report option. Each site can be configured with different scheduled report times. Data is not available for the current date until the scheduled report time elapses.</p>
