## Overview

The Zebra AI Data Capture SDK enables Java developers to create and deploy computer vision applications on Zebra mobile computing devices. Designed for both seasoned AI professionals and beginners, the SDK offers the tools and resources to leverage the AI capabilities offered on Zebra devices. 

SDK capabilities:

- **[Localizer](#localizer) -** Detects objects in images:
  - **Barcode Localizer -** Locates the barcodes within an image for decode.
  - **Shelf and Product Localizer -** Finds products, shelves, price labels, and shelf labels within an image.
- **[Product Recognition](#productrecognition) -** Utilizes **Feature Extractor, Feature Storage** and **Recognizer** components to build and store detailed visual data about retail products, enhancing inventory management. This process typically follows the use of **Shelf Localizer,** which detects products in images, crops them and submits them for recognition.
- **[Barcode Decoder](#barcodedecoder) -** Decodes single and multiple barcodes within images, generally after the **Barcode Localizer** detects and crops them for recognition.
- **[Text OCR](#textocr) -** Detects and recognizes text characters in images, capturing them as words or paragraphs.

## New in v2.22.10

- Added ability to configure options in [barcode symbologies](../barcodedecoder/#barcodesymbologies).

---

## Localizer

[Localizer](../localizer/) detects objects in images using supported models and outputs the location of the detected objects.

- **Barcode Localizer -** Detects 1D and 2D barcodes in images, suitable for various use cases such as identifying barcodes on product boxes, shelves and shipping labels.

- **Shelf and Product Localizer** Detects and identifies objects on retail shelves, aiding inventory management, optimizing space and ensuring accurate labeling. The types of objects detected include:

  - **Products -** Identifies individual products on the shelf, facilitating inventory tracking and automating stock checks.
  - **Shelf Labels -** Detects and reads shelf labels, ensuring that products are accurately priced and labeled.
  - **Peg Labels -** Recognizes peg labels used for hanging products, aiding in efficient product organization.
  - **Shelves -** Detects the presence and structure of shelves themselves, helping in understanding shelf layouts and optimizing space usage.

## Product Recognition

[Product Recognition](../productrecognition/) builds a database to facilitate inventory tracking and automated checkouts. The [Feature Extractor](../productrecognition/#featureextractor/) isolates key features from images, generating descriptors - vectors of float values that capture an item's characteristics - and stores them in [Feature Storage](../productrecognition/#featurestorage/) to enable product recognition. After a database of recognizable products is established, the [Product Recognizer](../productrecognition/#recognizer/) performs semantic searches to locate matching descriptors, predicting the identities of products on the shelf.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img alt="image" style="height:500px"  src="./feature-extractor.jpg" /></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td><img alt="image" style="height:500px"  src="./product-recognizer.jpg" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample of extracted item</i></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample of items recognized in the image and displayed with their corresponding data</i></td>
    <tr>
</table>

## Barcode Decoder

The **[Barcode Decoder](../barcodedecoder/)** decodes various types of barcodes detected within images, using the **[Barcode Localizer](#barcodelocalizer)** to first identify barcode locations, and then decoding from entire images or specific regions, handling both single and multiple barcodes per image.

<!-- // Remove per Kranthi, this was for internal use
Zebra provides computer vision models in  ‘model archives’ via the [ATOM Model Registry](https://atom.zebra.com/tools/registry) that can be loaded by the Vision SDK to provide the capabilities described above through the SDK APIs.

A summary of the models is provided below and more details can be found for each model and how to use it within the Vision SDK in the [ATOM Model Registry](https://atom.zebra.com/tools/registry).

## Text OCR

The **[Text OCR](../textocr/)** model detects and decodes text characters in images, offering suggestions for recognized characters or words. It adapts to various fonts and input sizes, allowing for effective text recognition at different distances. Detected words can be grouped into 'lines' or 'paragraphs.'
