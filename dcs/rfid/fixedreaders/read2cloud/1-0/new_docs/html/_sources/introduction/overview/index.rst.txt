Interfaces
==========

``Zebra IoT Connector`` feature provides the three interfaces as listed below.

Management Interface
--------------------

The Management Interface provides both a ``command/response`` interface and an ``asyncrhonous event`` interface. 
    * The ``command/response`` interface can be used to perform management actions on the reader (for example, firmware upgrade, getting reader configuration, and setting reader configuration). 
    * The ``asyncrhonous event`` interface can be used to monitor health events from the reader.

Control Interface
-----------------

The Control Interface is a ``command/response`` interface. It is used to perform control actions on the reader (for example, configuring the radio mode, starting/stopping the tag reads).

Data Interface
--------------

The Data Interface provides a ``asynchronous event`` interface. It is used to consume the RFID tag data from the reader.


.. important::

    Interfaces can be configured independently to allow for access via cloud or locally within the private network.

    Description of configuring the interfaces can be found :ref:`here <cloud_config_schema>`

Reader Components
=================

The reader contains a number of software components that enable Cloud Connect for RFID.

Reader Gateway or Cloud Agent
-----------------------------

The Reader Gateway/Cloud Agent is the component responsible for connecting to the outside world. The Management and Control requests are received by the Reader Gateway/Cloud Agent and passed along to be handled by the appropiate component. The Reader Gateway/Cloud Agent also collects the tag data from the Radio Control and pushes them out on the Data interface.

Radio Control
-------------

The Radio Control component configures, controls, and maintains a connection to the RFID radio. Radio control receives the tag read events from the radio and sends them to the Reader Gateway/Cloud Agent which in turn passes it onto the Data interface.

Reader Manager
--------------

The Reader Manager is the component responsible for performing all reader configuration and management operations.

Reader Webserver
----------------

The Reader Webserver presents a web console to control the reader. When Cloud Connect Management and Control Interfaces are configured for Local REST mode, the Reader Webserver handles the REST requests before passing the requests to the Reader Gateway/Cloud Agent.
