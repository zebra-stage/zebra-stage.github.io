=============================
IBM Watson IoT Platform Setup
=============================

This page guide user to setup ``IBM Cloud`` free acount with Watson IoT Platform and Create a device Type and Add device.

Setup a IBM Cloud with Watson IoT Platform
==========================================

1.	An `IBM Cloud® account <https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/>`_.

2.	A Watson IoT Platform instance.

    You can create a ``Watson IoT Platform`` instance directly from the `Watson IoT Platform page in the IBM Cloud Services Catalog <https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform/>`_.

Register your device
====================

Registering a device involves classifying the device as a device type, giving the device a name, and providing device information. Then you provide a connection token or accept a token that is generated by Watson IoT Platform.

.. tip::

    You can register your devices one at a time from the Watson `IoT Platform dashboard <https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/>`_, or you can use the `Watson IoT Platform API <https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/apis/swagger/v0002/org-admin.html#!/Device_Bulk_Configuration/post_bulk_devices_add>`_ to add multiple devices.

To add a device from the Watson IoT Platform dashboard:
-------------------------------------------------------

1.	In the IBM Cloud console, click ``Launch`` on the Watson IoT Platform service details page.

    The Watson IoT Platform web console opens in a new browser tab at the following URL:
 	
    .. code-block::

        https://org_id.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/#/overview

    Where *org_id* is the ID of your Watson IoT Platform organization.

2.	In the Overview dashboard, from the menu pane, select ``Device``s and then click ``Add Device``.

3.	Create a device type for the device that you are adding.

    Each device that is connected to the Watson IoT Platform must be associated with a device type. Device types are groups of devices that share common characteristics.

    a.	Click ``Create device type``.
    
    b.	Enter a device name, such as my_device_type, and a description for the device type.

    .. important::
        
        The device type name must be no more than 36 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters (``a-z``, ``A-Z``, ``0-9``) and any of the following characters: ``_``, ``.``, and ``-``.
    
    c.	Enter device type attributes and metadata.

4.	Click ``Next`` to begin the process of adding your device with the selected device type.

5.	Enter a device ID, for example reader hostname *FX9600XXXX*.

    The ``device ID`` is used to identify the device in the Watson IoT Platform dashboard and is also a required parameter for connecting your device to Watson IoT Platform.

    .. important::
    
        The device type name must be no more than 36 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters (``a-z``, ``A-Z``, ``0-9``) and any of the following characters: ``_``, ``.``, and ``-``.

        For network connected devices, the device ID could be the device MAC address without any separating colons.

6.	Click ``Next`` to complete the process.

7.	Provide an authentication token or accept an automatically generated token. If you choose to create your own token, make sure that it is between 8 and 36 characters long and consists only of alphanumeric characters and the following characters: ``_``, ``.``, ``!``, ``&``, ``@``, ``\*``, ``+``, ``(``, ``)``, and ``-``.

    .. important::
        
        The token must not contain repeated character sequences, dictionary words, user names, or other predefined sequences.

8.	Verify the summary information is correct and then click Add to add the connection.

9.	In the device information page, copy and save the following details:

    •	Organization ID
    •	Device type
    •	Device ID
    •	Authentication method
    •	Authentication token

    .. important::
        You'll need the ``organization ID``, ``device type``, ``device ID``, and ``authentication token`` to configure your device to connect to Watson IoT Platform.
