Configuring Deployment Modes
============================

As described earlier, the Zebra IoT Connector feature can be configured to one of the three deployment modes. The deployment mode can be configured by adding Endpoint Configurations and Mapping the configration to Management, Management Events, Control, and Tag Data Events interfaces. Each of these interfaces can be configured to either connect to a cloud service or allow local access.

There are two ways to configure the interfaces to any of the deployment modes:

    1. :ref:`RM_interface`.
    2. :ref:`RW_interface`.

.. _RM_interface:

Using Reader Manager Interface
==============================

To configure the interfaces to any of the deployment modes, the steps below must be performed.

1. Create endpoint JSON object following the schema :ref:`ENDPOINT CONFIG`

2. ADD endpoint to reader by sending an RM command to the reader.

3. UPDATE the interface mapping to the endpoint created in previous step by sending an RM command to the reader.

4. Connect the reader to the endpoint by sending an RM command to the reader.
