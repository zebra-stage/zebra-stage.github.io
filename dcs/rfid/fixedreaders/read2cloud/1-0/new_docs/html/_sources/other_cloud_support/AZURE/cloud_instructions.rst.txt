Azure IoT Hub Setup
===================

This page guide user to setup ``Azure`` free acount with IoT Hub and Create a device under Hub.

.. _self_certs:

Create device self-signed certificates
======================================

1.	Generate the IoT deviceâ€™s x509 Certificate and the Private Key Certificate by using the below OpenSSL command from a PowerShell window or Linux terminal

    Open PowerShell or Linux terminal and navigate to your desired working directory and run the following command.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydevkitkey.pem -x509 -days 365 -out mydevkitcertificate.pem

    * ``mydevkitkey.pem``: is a Private Key.
    
    * ``mydevkitcertificate.pem``: is the actual x509 certificate file.

    sample code is shown below:

2. Capture the x509 certificate Fingerprint either ``SHA1`` or ``SHA256`` type.

    SHA1:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ openssl x509 -in mydevkitcertificate.pem -fingerprint -noout.
        
    SHA256:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ openssl x509 -in mydevkitcertificate.pem -fingerprint -noout -sha256
    
    .. important::

        Copy the fingerprint hexadecimal number with 40 lengths [for SHA1 type].

        Remove the ``:`` from the fingerprint and it will look as shown below.

        **3989467851D9C76811C3B1DF939AE0A103E838CA**
    
3. Copy the `Microsoft DigiCert Baltimore Root cert <https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/certs/certs.c>`_ as ``ca.pem`` file - used globally. Make sure to remove the double quotes and the line feeds.

Create the new IoT Hub and Add device to Azure Portal - IoT Hub
===============================================================

1. Create an Azure account following the steps mentions @ `https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/ <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/>`_ (Ignore this step if already have account).

2. Login to Azure Portal.

3. Create an IoT hub using the steps mentioned in @ `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal>`_

4. Create Device.

    1. For ``Device ID`` use the reader hostname or the Common name used while generating certificate.
    
    2. Select x.509 self-signed as authentication type.
    
    3. For ``Primary Thumbprint`` use fingerprint generated :ref:`self_certs`.
