Test Reader Connection To Cloud
===============================

1. Device connection status can be viewed from IBM Watson IoT Platform Console.

2. Check Recent Events for Heartbeat events coming to cloud from device to ``Asyncevents`` topic.

3. For sending commands to device, we have to use `IBM Watson IoT Platform HTTP Messaging API Publish command API <https://q9jg0s.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/docs/v0002/http-messaging.html#/>`_.

4. To access the API, we have to generate API keys. Navigate to APPs and click ``Generate API Key``.

10. ``start/stop`` tag read events.

    * command to start tag reads.

        .. code-block:: json

            {
                "command": "start",
                "command_id": "16266718797272556",
                "payload": {}
            }
        
        .. figure:: images/IBM17.png
        
    * command to stop tag reads.

        .. code-block:: json

            {
                "command": "stop",
                "command_id": "16266718797272556",
                "payload": {}
            }
