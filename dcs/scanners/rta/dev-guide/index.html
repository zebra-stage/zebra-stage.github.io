                                                    <h3 id="rta-highlights-overview" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#rta-highlights-overview"><span></span></a>What are Real Time Alerts?</h3>

                                                    <p>Many Zebra scanner devices support active monitoring of device performance over time. Such statistical data is collected and stored locally on each device. This data can be retrieved with directives from Zebra's IoT Connector utility or by sending Corescanner API commands to the scanner device using the Scanner SDK Sample Application for example.</p>

                                                    <p>When a notification of a critical change to a scanner device is needed, a feature called “Real Time Alerts” can be used to transmit alerts from the scanner or cradle to a host when certain requested statistic values change, or events occur.</p>

                                                    <p>Real Time Alerts (RTA) are preselected events that are monitored by a scanner device. When a selected statistic has reached a specified value or when a selected event occurs, it is then reported by the scanner device to the host as an Alert.</p>

                                                    <p>Alerts have prerequisites. The scanner device and its installed firmware must support RTA monitoring, and the data or feature being monitored must be enabled on the device before an alert can be registered. This is done by updating the device's settings with a tool like 123Scan, or by scanning parameters from its Product Reference Guide. For example, if an Alert pertains to an embedded weight scale, the Scale feature must be enabled for the alert to be Registered.</p>

                                                    <P>Alerts have a lifecycle.  An alert begins by being registered with a command from the host using a Zebra supplied API or the SDK Sample Application.  The registration specifies the statistic value or event of interest and any desired target values that would cause an alert to be fired. An alert ends when its registration is cancelled or when the host connection with the scanner is lost.</P>

                                                    <p>Once registered, alerts produce events that have specified start and end conditions. An alert is turned “on” when the specified event or value is seen by the device, and is turned “off” when the specified event clears or a statistic reaches a specified value.  Each alert is designed to start and end on its own, without any required interaction with the host.</p>

                                                    <h3 id="rta-highlights-access" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#rta-highlights-access"><span></span></a>How to access Real Time Alerts data</h3>

                                                    <p>Each scanner model maintains a selection of alerts that it supports, and the client's host system can register and configure the Alerts that are of concern.</p>

                                                    <p>Zebra provides a few ways to access scanner device attributes and statistics. These can be manually viewed using a downloadable sample application.  Source code of this sample application in C# can be customized to suit your needs. Additionally, Zebra provides the IoT Connector utility that can be used to monitor changes to Statistics values on the scanner or cradle device, as well as Real Time Alert events.</p>

                                                    <p>Zebra provides downloadable utilities, code libraries, interfaces and services that assist in the use of the Real Time Alert features. RTA features have been added to the following Zebra host software:</p>

                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li><strong>Core Scanner API</strong> The CoreScanner service/daemon provides the APIs required to configure and receive data from a device's RTA-capable firmware.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>IoT Connector</strong> The IoT Connector ties together the RTA messages in addition to Statistic and Event data monitoring to provide a complete solution for the customer.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>Unified POS, OPOS, JPOS APIs</strong> The Unified POS API (UPOS) provided with the Zebra Scanner SDK can be used to exchange RTA configuration data using XML files.  Similarly, there are APIs for the OPOS standard as well as the JavaPOS (JPOS) standard.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>Simple Serial Interface</strong> Some scanner devices support the Simple Serial Interface (SSI) that has the capability to carry Zebra's Remote Scanner Management (RSM) commands necessary to configure Real Time Alerts.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>SNAPI Interface</strong> There is a USB-SNAPI protocol supported by Zebra devices that has the capability to carry the Remote Scanner Management (RSM) commands necessary to configure Real Time Alerts.</li>
                                                    </ul>

                                                    <h3 id="rta-iot-connector" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#rta-iot-connector"><span></span></a>IoT (Internet of Things) Connector</h3>

                                                    <p>The IoT Connector is a utility that will log scanner related events to an endpoint such as a command prompt or terminal window, and/or text file, HTTP instance or Windows Event log. The events that can be logged through the IoT Connector are defined in the file IoTConnector-Config.xml and their properties can be changed depending on need.</p>

                                                    <p>The IoT Connector accesses scanner devices through the Zebra CoreScanner Service for Windows or Linux which must first be installed and running.</p>

                                                    <p>The IoT Connector allows a 3rd party management console, like Microsoft's SCCM, to track scanner information including the scanner's health by parsing an IoT Connector generated log file.</p>

                                                    <p>The IoT Connector will output log entries to a sink (endpoint) as defined in its IoTConnector-Config.xml file.</p>

                                                    <p>The IoT Connector is configurable and can document RTA Events as they happen</p>

                                                    <p>The IoT Connector can have its output stored locally on its host PC or output to a network shared folder, HTTP instance or Windows Event log.</p>

                                                    <p>The RTA feature will remain disabled until one or more RTA Alerts are registered. This registration occurs when the host system sends a message to the device telling it to enable one or more alerts.</p>

                                                    <p>In its simplest form, a single scanning device is connected to a host interface.  Software on the host device can send RTA configuration data and commands to register for events and to receive alerts.</p>

                                                    <p>Some scanning devices are connected to a host via a wireless connection to a cradle, or as an auxiliary wired scanner connected to a primary scanning device.   In this case, the RTA commands and data are routed to and from the scanner from one device to the next until reaching the host.  Each device in the chain is automatically assigned a “context address”, and this address conveys to the host the endpoint where the RTA commands and data originate.  When a scanner connects to the chain of devices, RTA will not be enabled until it is given a “Context Address”.</p>

                                                    <p>Once a compliant scanning device has one or more alerts registered, and it is assigned a Context Address, then the Real Time Alerts feature goes online.</p>

                                                    <p>The following diagram shows the states of the Real Time Alerts feature in an individual scanner or cradle device.</p>

                                                    <div style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

                                                    </div><br />

                                                    <p>The Host system can look up the current state of the Real Time Alert feature.   Note that if a device does not immediately have a Context Address, it usually resolves itself in a minute.  The following table shows the meaning of the RTA state value returned when requested by the host.</p>

Some alerts have a configurable limit value that specifies when the alert is turned “off”. Depending on the type of alert, On-Limit and Off-Limit values are configurable with Corescanner REGISTER_RTA_EVENTS  command  (Refer to the RTA tab in the Scanner SDK Sample Application). For some alerts, both the On-Limit and Off-Limit value settings must be configured for the “Measuring” status to be set.  Otherwise, the “Measuring” status is cleared at initialization.</p>

                                                    <p>The features of RTA depend on a continuous connection between the scanning device and the host. Should a disconnect be detected between the host and the scanning device, then all the alerts registered on the scanning device are cancelled. They need to be re-registered to resume operation.</p>

                                                    <p>One aspect of RTA operation is that it can send an event message at any time.  These asynchronous messages may present a problem to host systems that are busy with a critical operation. An example is when the firmware is being updated on the scanning device.   To help prevent any problems, the host may send a request for RTA to Suspend.   In this state, RTA retains all of its settings, but the detection and reporting of RTA Events is temporarily stopped.   The host can later cancel the RTA Suspend and the RTA feature resumes where it left off.</p>
