Formerly known as “Application Restrictions,” this mechanism was originally conceived as a means of exposing restrictions on Android device applications that could be imposed from outside, such as by an EMM. For example, the Chrome web browser exposed the ability show or hide the address bar and to store passwords.</p>

<p>The Android community over time recognized that applications might expose more than just restrictions, and the name was changed to Managed Configurations. Zebra recognized that through use of a specially designed app, the Managed Configuration mechanism could be used to manage the device itself. This application, called Zebra OEMConfig, has been reviewed and approved by Google and several key EMM Vendors, and is now the Google-recommended approach for use by OEMs to publish extended functionality, and for use by EMMs to leverage that extended functionality.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../oemdev">OEMConfig Integration Guide</a> for more information.  </p>

<h2 id="transactionandschemalevel" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionandschemalevel"><span></span></a>Transaction and Schema Level</h2>

<p>This section describes Managed Configurations that are used internally by an EMM to manage transactions that apply configurations defined by an Administrator to a Zebra Android device and/or to obtain information about the Schema that defines available configuration options. </p>

<h3 id="schemapackagename" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#schemapackagename"><span></span></a>Schema Package Name</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM solution or other tool consuming the OEMConfig Schema to determine the Package Name of the Package that implements that Schema.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Zebra Schema is published by the OEMConfig package. Therefore, if the Schema is obtained from that package through the Android system, the package name of that package is already known.</li>

<li>If the Schema for OEMConfig is obtained in some other way, such as by download or direct import, this Managed Configuration can be used as a confirmation mechanism and/or to determine the package to which Managed Configurations created using this Schema should be sent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schemacontractversion" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#schemacontractversion"><span></span></a>Schema Contract Version</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM solution or other tool consuming the OEMConfig Schema to determine the Contract Version being used by that Schema. The Contract Version is expressed in the form <em>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</em> (i.e. "1.5"). </p>

<ul>
<li>The value of <em>&lt;major&gt;</em> changes when there is significant change in the Managed Configurations supported by OEMConfig, such as when a change of Android version enables major new functionality.</li>

<li>The value of <em>&lt;minor&gt;</em> changes when there is some less significant change in the Managed Configurations supported by OEMConfig, such as when one or a few additional Managed Configurations are added.</li>

<li>Neither value changes if modifications to the Schema do not affect the Managed Configurations supported by OEMConfig, such as for cosmetic changes.</li>

<li>See the Managed Configuration <strong>Schema UI Revision</strong> for more information about cosmetic changes that do not affect the Contract Version.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schemauirevision" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#schemauirevision"><span></span></a>Schema UI Revision</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM solution or other tool consuming the OEMConfig Schema to determine the UI Revision of the Schema being used.</p>

<p>The UI Revision is expressed in the form of a simple integer value (i.e. "3"). </p>

<ul>
<li>The value changes when there are changes to the Schema do not affect the Managed Configurations supported by OEMConfig, but affect only the UI that might be generated based on that Schema.</li>

<li>Examples of cosmetic changes that might be indicated using this Managed Configuration include changes in the <em>Title</em> or <em>Description</em> of Managed Configurations or changes to the textual values displayed for a pull-down list of choices.</li>

<li>See the Managed Configuration <strong>Schema Contract Version</strong> for more information about changes that affect the Contract Version.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schemavariant" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#schemavariant"><span></span></a>Schema Variant</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM solution or other tool consuming the OEMConfig Schema to determine the Variant of that Schema being used.</p>

<p>The Schema Variant is expressed in the form of an identifying string and could have a variety of possible values. </p>

<ul>
<li>By definition, all Schemas that have the same values for the Managed Configurations <strong>Schema Package Name</strong> and <strong>Schema Contract Version</strong> should be considered to implement subsets of the Master Schema associated by those two values.</li>

<li>The Master Schema can be identified by a Schema Variant value of <strong><em>Master</em></strong>.</li>

<li>All other Schema Variant values indicates various subsets of that Master Schema and those values is generally chosen to identify the class of Zebra Android devices that implement that subset of Managed Configurations, for example:


<ul>
<li>The Schema Variant value <strong><em>Value Tier N</em></strong> might indicate the subset of Managed Configurations supported on Value Tier Zebra Android devices running Android Nougat.</li>

<li>The Schema Variant value <strong><em>Premium N-V1</em></strong> might indicate the subset of Managed Configurations supported on Premium Zebra Android devices running Android Nougat and that implement the V1 feature set.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transactionid" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionid"><span></span></a>Transaction ID</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to specify a Transaction ID that identifies a collection of configurations that can be performed by submitting a collection of Managed Configurations in a Bundle to OEMConfig for processing on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<p>OEMConfig uses the Transaction ID value specified in this Managed Configuration to differentiate transactions submitted over time.</p>

<ul>
<li>OEMConfig processes Managed Configurations in a Bundle submitted to OEMConfig if the Transaction ID is set to a different value than the value previously set.</li>

<li>The Transaction ID used can be any string value convenient for the EMM to use to identify the transaction.</li>

<li>It is expected that a suitably different Transaction ID value is created by the EMM each time a new collection of Managed Configurations is created in accordance with the OEMConfig Schema.</li>

<li>While a Transaction ID value does not need to be unique, it should be different from any prior value recently used.</li>

<li>When creating and storing collections of Managed Configurations for long term use, it is generally considered <strong>best practice</strong> to create truly unique values, such as by generating a GUID.</li>

<li>If the EMM requests notification of the completion of a transaction, the Transaction ID is attached to the Transaction Result Intent to identify the transaction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transactionresultintenttype" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionresultintenttype"><span></span></a>Transaction Result Intent Type</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to request OEMConfig to send a notification of the completion of a transaction by sending a Transaction Result Intent when it has finished processing the transaction.</p>

<p>If sending a Transaction Result Intent is desired, this Managed Configuration MUST be set to indicate the type of intent to be sent.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>startActivity</em></strong>- an EMM Activity is notified of the completion of the transaction by sending an intent using the Android method <em>Context.startActivity()</em>.


<ul>
<li>It is generally considered <strong>best practice</strong> to specify values for one or more of the Managed Configurations <strong>Transaction Result Intent Action</strong>, <strong>Transaction Result Intent Component</strong>, or <strong>Transaction Result Intent Extra Name</strong> and <strong>Transaction Result Intent Extra Value</strong> to ensure that the intent is sent to the right Activity and/or to help differentiate the intent from others that might be sent to that Activity.</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong><em>startService</em></strong>- an EMM Service is notified of the completion of the transaction by sending an intent using the Android method <em>Context.startService()</em>.


<ul>
<li>It is generally considered <strong>best practice</strong> to specify values for one or more of the Managed Configurations <strong>Transaction Result Intent Action</strong>, <strong>Transaction Result Intent Component</strong>, or <strong>Transaction Result Intent Extra Name</strong> and <strong>Transaction Result Intent Extra Value</strong> to ensure that the intent is sent to the right Service and/or to help differentiate the intent from others that might be sent to that Service.</li></ul>
</li>

<li><strong><em>sendBroadcast</em></strong>- an EMM is notified of the completion of the transaction by sending an intent using the Android method <em>Context.sendBroadcast()</em>.


<ul>
<li>It is generally considered <strong>best practice</strong> to specify values for one or more of the Managed Configurations <strong>Transaction Result Intent Action</strong> or <strong>Transaction Result Intent Extra Name</strong> and <strong>Transaction Result Intent Extra Value</strong> to help differentiate the intent from others that might be sent to the same receiver.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Transaction ID value specified in the Managed Configuration <strong>Transaction ID</strong> is attached to the Transaction Result Intent to identify the transaction for which the notification is being sent.</p>

<h3 id="transactionresultintentaction" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionresultintentaction"><span></span></a>Transaction Result Intent Action</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to request that OEMConfig specify an Intent Action when sending a Transaction Result Intent when it has finished processing of the transaction and should generally be specified only if the Managed Configuration <strong>Transaction Result Intent Type</strong> is also specified.</p>

<p>While specifying an Intent Action is not required when sending a Transaction Result Intent, it is generally considered <strong>good practice</strong> to do so to help the receiver of the intent differentiate it from other intents it might receive. </p>

<h3 id="transactionresultintentcomponent" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionresultintentcomponent"><span></span></a>Transaction Result Intent Component</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to request that OEMConfig specify a Component when sending a Transaction Result Intent when it has finished processing of the transaction and should generally be specified only if the Managed Configuration <strong>Transaction Result Intent Type</strong> is also specified.</p>

<p>While specifying a Component is not required when sending a Transaction Result Intent, it is generally considered <strong>good practice</strong> to do so since it can help ensure that the intent is sent to the right receiver.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Since broadcast intents are sent globally, they cannot be directed to a specific receiver. As a result, a Component should be specified only when the value chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Transaction Result Intent Type</strong> is <strong><em>startActivity</em></strong> or <strong><em>startService</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="transactionresultintentextraname" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionresultintentextraname"><span></span></a>Transaction Result Intent Extra Name</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to request that OEMConfig attach a String Extra whose, Extra Name is specified, to the Transaction Result Intent when it has finished processing of the transaction.</p>

<p>Specifying a String Extra is optional when sending a Transaction Result Intent, although it might be useful to do so since it can help ensure that the receiver of the intent can differentiate it from other intents that it might receive.</p>

<ul>
<li>When an Extra Name is specified using this Managed Configuration, it is required that an Extra Value also be specified using the Managed Configuration <strong><em>Transaction Result Intent Extra Value</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transactionresultintentextravalue" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionresultintentextravalue"><span></span></a>Transaction Result Intent Extra Value</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to request that OEMConfig attach a String Extra, whose Extra Value is specified, to the Transaction Result Intent when it has finished processing of the transaction.</p>

<p>Specifying a String Extra is optional when sending a Transaction Result Intent, although it might be useful to do so since it can help ensure that the receiver of the intent can differentiate it from other intents that it might receive.</p>

<ul>
<li>When an Extra Value is specified using this Managed Configuration, it is required that an Extra Name also be specified using the Managed Configuration <strong><em>Transaction Result Intent Extra Name</em></strong>. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transactionsteps" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionsteps"><span></span></a>Transaction Steps</h3>

<p>Allows an EMM to enable an Administrator to defined a sequence of steps that perform configuration of various configurations and to organize those steps into a single transaction performed on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<p>Any number of transaction steps can be included within a transaction and the individual transactions steps is executed in the order they appear within this Managed Configuration. </p>

<h4 id="transactionstep" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionstep"><span></span></a>Transaction Step</h4>

<p>Allows an EMM to enable an Administrator to specify a single transaction step that defines one or more configurations performed on a Zebra Android device as part of a transaction.</p>

<p>Multiple configurations of different types can optionally be defined as part of a single transaction step, but an Administrator CANNOT control the order or execution of such configurations within a given step.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The system executes multiple configurations within the same step in an order designed to maximize the chance that all configurations can be successfully executed.</p></li>

<li><p>If an Administrator needs to tightly control the order of relative execution of various configurations, they should be included into different transaction steps so their order can be controlled by ordering those steps within the transaction.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following section <strong>Transaction Step Level</strong> describes the Managed Configurations that are available for an Administrator to use to define the configurations that can be perform as a part of a transaction step. </p>

<hr>

<h2 id="transactionsteplevel" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionsteplevel"><span></span></a>Transaction Step Level</h2>

<p>This section describes Managed Configurations that allow an Administrator using an EMM to define the configuration performed as part of a step within a transaction, to describe the step, and to define how errors that occur during the step is handled. </p>

<h3 id="transactionstepexplanation" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionstepexplanation"><span></span></a>Transaction Step Explanation</h3>

<p>Used to specify optional explanatory text that describes the purpose or intended behavior of a transaction step.</p>

<p>Since a transaction might include multiple steps and each transaction step could include one or more configurations, describing the step can be invaluable when later reviewing the configuration defined by a transaction and/or when editing a transaction, especially when reordering the steps within a transaction. </p>

<h3 id="transactionsteperrormode" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#transactionsteperrormode"><span></span></a>Transaction Step Error Mode</h3>

<p>Used to define how errors that occur during the execution of a transaction step should be handled.</p>

<p>Since a transaction might include multiple steps and each transaction step could include one or more configurations, there might be cases where steps within a transaction are dependent on steps earlier in the same transaction. In such cases, it might be desirable to terminate a transaction if the processing of a step results in an error to avoid propagating the results of that error into subsequent steps.</p>

<p>By default, execution continues with the next transaction step once execution of the current step is completed.</p>

<p>A decision to override this default behavior can be made independently for each step within a transaction by supplying an Error Mode value:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An Error Mode value of <strong><em>Continue</em></strong> indicates that any errors that occur during the execution of the current transaction step should NOT terminate execution of subsequent steps in the same transaction. Execution thus always continues with the next transaction step once execution of the current step is completed.</p></li>

<li><p>An Error Mode value of <strong><em>Stop</em></strong> indicates that any errors that occur during the execution of the current transaction step should terminate execution of subsequent steps in the same transaction. Execution continues with the next transaction step only if execution of the current step completes with NO errors. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analyticsconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#analyticsconfiguration"><span></span></a>Analytics Configuration</h2>

<p>This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure the Analytics Client in a Zebra Android device. </p>

<h3 id="state" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#state"><span></span></a>State</h3>

<p>Used to configure whether the Analytics Client on a Zebra Android device is turned on (enabled) or turned off (disabled).</p>

<p>The Analytics Client is turned on (enabled) by default on all Zebra Android devices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Off</em></strong>- the Analytics Client is turned off (disabled), and does not collect machine data during the operation of the device and does NOT deliver machine data regardless of whether connectivity is available.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>On</em></strong>- the Analytics Client is turned on (enabled), and automatically collects machine data during the operation of the device and delivers it when (connectivity is available) to the Zebra Analytics Cloud Server.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The ability for an Administrator to use an EMM to turn off (disable) the Analytics Client is not supported on some devices.</p>

<h3 id="usercontrolofstate" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#usercontrolofstate"><span></span></a>User Control of State</h3>

<p>Used to configure whether the Device User is allowed to control the state (enabled/disabled) of the Analytics Client on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<p>The Analytics Client is turned on (enabled) by default on all Zebra Android devices.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Off</em></strong>- the Device User prevented from changing the state (enabled/disabled) of the Analytics Client and whether it collects and/or delivers machine data during the operation of the device.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>On</em></strong>- the Device User is allowed to change the state (enabled/disabled) of the Analytics Client and whether it collects and/or delivers machine data during the operation of the device.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="audioconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#audioconfiguration"><span></span></a>Audio Configuration</h2>

<p>This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure the audio settings on a Zebra Android device. </p>

<h3 id="mutevibrate" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#mutevibrate"><span></span></a>Mute/Vibrate</h3>

<p>Used to configure the mute and vibrate behavior of a Zebra Android device.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Mute without Vibrate</em></strong>- the volume is muted (made silent) and the device does NOT vibrate, permitting neither audible nor tactile alerts.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Mute with Vibrate</em></strong>- the volume is muted (made silent) and the device vibrates, permitting both audible and tactile alerts.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Unmute without Vibrate</em></strong>- the volume is unmuted (made audible) and the device does NOT vibrate, permitting audible but not tactile alerts. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="replicationaction" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#replicationaction"><span></span></a>Replication Action</h3>

<p>Used to configure the audio replication behavior of of a Zebra Android device.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Replicate headset audio on built-in speaker</em></strong>- audio routed to the headset also is routed to the built-in speaker. This might be desirable in a situation where the Device User might walk away from a vehicle mounted device and leave the headset in the vehicle while performing some task nearby. If an audible alert is also routed to the built-in speaker, the Device User might still hear it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Do not replicate headset audio on built-in speaker</em></strong>- audio routed to the headset also is routed to the built-in speaker. This might be desirable in a situation where the device is being used in an area where routing audio to the built-in speaker could be disruptive to others in the area. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="autotriggerconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#autotriggerconfiguration"><span></span></a>Auto Trigger Configuration</h2>

<p>This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure whether and how automatic triggering occurs on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<p>Automatic triggering allows a Device User to initiate trigger-activated functions simply by bringing an object within proximity of the device sensor as opposed to requiring the Device User to manually initiate such functions. </p>

<h3 id="state-1" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#state-1"><span></span></a>State</h3>

<p>Used to configure whether and how automatic triggering should occur on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Off</em></strong>- automatic triggering never occurs and the Device User is required to manually initiate trigger-activated functions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Auto On</em></strong>- automatic triggering might occur automatically if the device is placed into a suitable holster, holder, or stand allowing the Device User to initiate trigger-activated functions simply by bringing an object within proximity to the device sensor.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Always On</em></strong>- automatic triggering can always occur automatically , whether or not the device is placed into a suitable holster, holder, or stand allowing the Device User to initiate trigger-activated functions simply by bringing an object within proximity to the device sensor. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="range" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#range"><span></span></a>Range</h3>

<p>Used to configure the range at which automatic triggering detects the presence of an object and initiate automatic triggering.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Near</em></strong>- automatic triggering occurs only when an object is brought within near proximity to the device sensor. This might be desirable if the device is being worn in a holster and it's convenient to bring objects close to the device sensor.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Far</em></strong>- automatic triggering occurs when an object is brought within less near proximity to the device sensor. This might be desirable if the device is located in a stand or holder and it's less convenient to bring objects close to the device sensor. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="blacklistconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#blacklistconfiguration"><span></span></a>Blacklist Configuration</h2>

<p>This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure which built-in System Applications can/cannot be used on a Zebra Android device. </p>

<h3 id="action" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#action"><span></span></a>Action</h3>

<p>Used to perform an Action to enable or disable a single built-in System Application on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<p>All built-in System Applications are enabled by default on Zebra Android devices.
Enabling a built-in System Application allows it to be freely launched, either by the Device User or programmatically by other Applications. Disabling a built-in System Application prevents it from being launched, either by the Device User or programmatically by other Applications.</p>

<p>Since a built-in System Application is built-in, it cannot be uninstalled from a device, even if its use is not desired.
To prevent the use of a built-in System Application, it can be disabled and its use prevented while remaining installed.</p>

<p>The value of this Managed Configuration specifies an Action value of <strong><em>Enable</em></strong> or <strong><em>Disable</em></strong>.
Depending on the Action value chosen, one of the following Managed Configurations also must be specified to provide the package name of the built-in System Application being enabled or disabled.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Enable</em></strong>- the Managed Configuration <strong>Blacklist Configuration - Action Allow System Package</strong> must be used to specify the package name that identifies the built-in System Application being enabled.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Disable</em></strong>- the Managed Configuration <strong>Blacklist Configuration - Action Disallow System Package</strong> must be used to specify the package name that identifies the built-in System Application being disabled.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="allowsystempackagename" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#allowsystempackagename"><span></span></a>Allow System Package Name</h3>

<p>Used to specify a package name to identify a built-in System Application being <strong><em>Enabled</em></strong> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Enable</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Blacklist Configuration - Action</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="disallowsystempackagename" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#disallowsystempackagename"><span></span></a>Disallow System Package Name</h3>

<p>Used to specify a package name to identify a built-in System Application being <strong><em>Disabled</em></strong> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Disable</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Blacklist Configuration - Action</strong>. </p>

<hr>

<h2 id="bluetoothconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#bluetoothconfiguration"><span></span></a>Bluetooth Configuration</h2>

<p>This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure Bluetooth settings on a Zebra Android device.</p>

<h3 id="discoverability" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#discoverability"><span></span></a>Discoverability</h3>

<p>Used to configure whether the device is <em>Discoverable</em> via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Zebra Android devices are NOT <em>Discoverable</em> via Bluetooth by default except when the Bluetooth Pairing screen of the Settings UI is active.</p>

<p>The value of this Managed Configuration can change this default behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Off</em></strong>- the default behavior is in effect and the device is NOT <em>Discoverable</em> via Bluetooth except when the Bluetooth Pairing screen of the Settings UI is active.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>On</em></strong>- the default behavior is overridden and the device is <em>Discoverable</em> via Bluetooth whenever Bluetooth is enabled (turned on).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="newpairings" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#newpairings"><span></span></a>New Pairings</h3>

<p>Used to configure whether the device accepts new Bluetooth Pairings.</p>

<p>Zebra Android devices accepts new Bluetooth Pairings by default.</p>

<p>The value of this Managed Configuration can change this default behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Off</em></strong>- the default behavior is overridden and the device does NOT accept new Bluetooth Pairings.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>On</em></strong>- the default behavior is in effect and the device accepts new Bluetooth Pairings. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turnonoffsilentpairing" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#turnonoffsilentpairing"><span></span></a>Turn On/Off Silent Pairing</h3>

<p>Used to configure whether the device can silently perform Bluetooth pairings</p>

<p>Zebra Android devices performs Bluetooth Pairings silently by default.</p>

<p>The value of this Managed Configuration can change this default behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Off</em></strong>- the default behavior is overridden and the device can not silently perform Bluetooth Pairings.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>On</em></strong>- the default behavior is in effect and the device can silently perform Bluetooth Pairings.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that even when the device CAN silently perform Bluetooth Pairings, it DOES NOT do so unless the Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action</strong> is used to configure the specific silent pairing permitted to occur.</p>

<h3 id="action-1" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#action-1"><span></span></a>Action</h3>

<p>Used to perform an Action to manage a list of rules that control Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em>.</p>

<p>Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> allows new Bluetooth Pairings to be automatically completed without Device User interaction, if permitted by defined rules.
Since the list of rules is empty by default on Zebra Android devices, Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> is disabled by default, and Device User interaction is required to complete any new Bluetooth Pairings.</p>

<p>The value of this Managed Configuration specifies an Action value of <strong><em>Add</em></strong> or <strong><em>Remove</em></strong>, thus allowing the list of rules to be managed.
Depending on the Action value chosen, one of the following Managed Configurations must also be specified:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Add</em></strong> is chosen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Name</strong> MUST be used to specify the name of the new rule being added.</p></li>

<li><p>At least ONE of the Managed Configurations <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Device Class</strong> or <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Device Upper Address Part</strong> MUST be used to specify the criteria that the new rule uses to determine which new Bluetooth Pairings is allowed.</p></li></ul></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Remove</em></strong>- at least ONE of the Managed Configurations <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Name</strong>, <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Device Class</strong>, or <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Device Upper Address Part</strong> MUST be used to specify the information used to determine which rule or rules (with matching information) are removed. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actionaddrulename" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddrulename"><span></span></a>Action Add Rule Name</h3>

<p>Used to specify a name for a new rule to add to the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Add</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action</strong>. </p>

<h3 id="actionaddruledeviceclass" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddruledeviceclass"><span></span></a>Action Add Rule Device Class</h3>

<p>Used to specify the <em>Device Class</em> for a new rule to add to the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Add</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action</strong>.</p>

<p>When a <em>Device Class</em> is specified for a rule, Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> automatically completes new Bluetooth Pairings for Bluetooth devices that have the specified <em>Device Class</em>. </p>

<h3 id="actionaddruledeviceupperaddresspart" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddruledeviceupperaddresspart"><span></span></a>Action Add Rule Device Upper Address Part</h3>

<p>Used to specify the <em>Device Upper Address Part</em> for a new rule to add to the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Add</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action</strong>.</p>

<p>When a <em>Device Upper Address Part</em> is specified for a rule, Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> automatically completes new Bluetooth Pairings for Bluetooth devices that have the specified <em>Device Upper Address Part</em> in the upper part of their <em>Bluetooth Address</em>. </p>

<h3 id="actionremoverulename" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionremoverulename"><span></span></a>Action Remove Rule Name</h3>

<p>Used to specify the name of an existing rule being removed from the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Remove</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action</strong>.</p>

<p>Any existing rule that has the specified name is removed. </p>

<h3 id="actionremoveruledeviceclass" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionremoveruledeviceclass"><span></span></a>Action Remove Rule Device Class</h3>

<p>Used to specify the <em>Device Class</em> of an existing rule being removed from the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth <em>Auto-Pairing</em> and should be specified only if the Action value <strong><em>Remove</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Bluetooth Configuration - Action</strong>.</p>

<p>Any existing rule or rules that have the specified <em>Device Class</em> is removed. </p>

<h3 id="action-5" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#action-5"><span></span></a>Action</h3>

<p>Used to perform an action to affect the behaviors mapped to the keys on the physical keyboard (if any) of a Zebra Android device.</p>

<p>The value of this Managed Configuration specifies one of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Add Mapping</em></strong>- a new mapping for a single physical key is added to the mapping tables for one or more keyboard states. The additional Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Key ID</strong> MUST be specified to identify the physical key for which mappings are to be added or replaced. In addition, the Managed Configuration array <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behaviors</strong> MUST also be specified to define the behavior(s) to be mapped to the identified physical key. If prior mappings are applied to specify the behaviors of the identified physical key, all are replaced by the new specified behaviors.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Reset All Mappings</em></strong>- the mapping tables are reset to their defaults. This effectively removes all mappings that have previously been added and returns the behaviors of all keys to their default out-of-box state. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that due to variations in keyboard size and layout, not all keyboard states are supported on all Zebra Android devices or on all keyboards possible on any given Zebra Android device. Some or all of the following values might be supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Base</em></strong>- the Base Mapping table is selected. The Base Mapping table defines the behavior performed for a physical key when it is pressed while no special keyboard state is active.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Blue</em></strong>- the Blue Mapping table is selected. The Blue Mapping table defines the behavior performed for a physical key when it is pressed in conditions where the Blue key has been used to activate the Blue keyboard state.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Orange</em></strong>- the Orange Mapping table is selected. The Orange Mapping table defines the behavior performed for a physical key when it is pressed in conditions where the Orange key has been used to activate the Orange keyboard state.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Grey</em></strong>- the Grey Mapping table is selected. The Grey Mapping table defines the behavior performed for a physical key when it is pressed in conditions where the Grey key has been used to activate the Grey keyboard state.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Shift</em></strong>- the Shift Mapping table is selected. The Shift Mapping table defines the behavior performed for a physical key when it is pressed in conditions where the Shift key has been used to activate the Shift keyboard state.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Control</em></strong>- the Control Mapping table is selected. The Control Mapping table defines the behavior performed for a physical key when it is pressed in conditions where the Control key has been used to activate the Control keyboard state.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actionaddmappingbehaviortype" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddmappingbehaviortype"><span></span></a>Action Add Mapping Behavior Type</h3>

<p>Used to specify the type of behavior performed when a specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active. The following values are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Send Key Code</em></strong>- the behavior performed when the specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active is to send a specified key code. This allows for "classic keyboard remapping" where the behavior of a key is changed to be the behavior of some other key, which might or might not be present on the physical keyboard. The additional Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Key Code</strong> MUST also be specified to provide the key code sent.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Send Trigger</em></strong>- the behavior performed when the specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active is to send a trigger signal. Trigger signals might be used to initiate various activities, such as barcode scanning, RFID reading, push to talk, etc. The additional Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Trigger</strong> MUST also be specified to select which trigger signal is sent.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Launch Application</em></strong>- the behavior performed when the specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active is to launch an application. The additional Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Launch Application Name</strong> MUST also be specified to provide the "friendly name" of the application to be launched. Note that this is NOT the Android Package Name. To launch an application by its Android Package Name, the value <strong><em>Send Intent</em></strong> should be used.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Send Intent</em></strong>- the behavior performed when the specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active is to send and Android Intent, which might cause any number of possible results, depending on the nature of the intent configured to be sent. Some of all of the following additional Managed Configurations MUST also be specified to define the Android Intent to be sent: <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Type</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Action</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Category</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Package Name</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Class</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Data URI</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Flags</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent MIME Type</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Extra Name</strong>, <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Extra Value</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sending an Android Intent provides a very flexible way to specify the behavior to be performed for a key by invoking an application or service. As such, there are many options that control the nature of the intent sent. Zebra recommends fully understanding the nature of the Android Intent to be sent before attempting to configure it as a key behavior. In many cases, the application or service to be invoked defines the nature of the intent it wishes to receive, and that definition can be used to drive the configuration.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Suppress</em></strong>- NO behavior is performed when the specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active. This is equivalent to mapping the key in that state to "do nothing".</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Reset To Default</em></strong>- the behavior performed when the specified key is pressed while the keyboard state associated with the specified Mapping table is active be reset back to its defaults. This effectively removes any prior mapping of that key in that state and return the key to its standard behavior in that state. </p></li>

In some cases, the same action value might be supported in more than one category. Consult the documentation or developer of a given application or service to determine whether a category value is needed and, if so, which value invokes the desired behavior. </p>

<h3 id="actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentpackagename" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentpackagename"><span></span></a>Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Package Name</h3>

<p>Used to specify the Android Package Name of the application or service to invoke when the value <strong><em>Send Intent</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type</strong>.</p>

<p>It is not required to specify the Android Package Name when sending an Android Intent, but is is often advisable.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>When an Android Package Name is specified, the intent becomes an Explicit Intent and the intent can ONLY be sent to an application or service with that Package Name and no other. This can increase security and is often used when the intent being sent requires any sensitive data. It is generally required to specify the additional Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Class</strong> whenever a Package Name is specified, since an Explicit Intent is always sent to an Android Component, which is identified by a Package Name and a Class within that Package.</li>

<li>When no Android Package Name is specified, the intent becomes an Implicit Intent and the intent might be sent to any application or service that has registered its ability to handle that intent. This can increase flexibility, and is often used when the intent being sent requires no sensitive data, and when it might be desirable to dynamically control which application or service is ultimately invoked to handle that intent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentdatauri" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentdatauri"><span></span></a>Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Data URI</h3>

<p>Used to specify a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that identifies some data, in the form of a resource on the device (i.e. a file in the device file system) or off the device (i.e. a resource available through a network) that should be utilized by the application or service invoked by the intent.</p>

<p>Whether the intended recipient of the intent expects a URI to be specified as part of the intent or not is up to that recipient and/or the definition of the intent that recipient is designed to consume. </p>

<h3 id="actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentflags" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentflags"><span></span></a>Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Flags</h3>

<p>Used to specify intent flags to be set for the intent to be sent. </p>

<p>Intent flags control how the intent is handled by Android. Some intent flags are specific to the type of component invoked by the Intent (i.e. activity vs. service).
Whether certain intent flags are needed to produce the desired result when the intended recipient of the intent is invoked is up to that recipient and/or the definition of the intent that recipient is designed to consume.
Intent flags must be specified as a hexadecimal value with the appropriate bits set for any flag or flags desired.
Consult the Android documentation to translate intent flag names, when needed, into their appropriate hexadecimal values.</p>

<h3 id="actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentmimetype" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#actionaddmappingbehaviortypesendintentmimetype"><span></span></a>Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent MIME Type</h3>

<p>Used to specify a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type to use when processing the intent data and should be specified only if the Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Data URI</strong> is specified.</p>

<p>Normally the type is inferred from the data itself. Setting a MIME type explicitly, by using this Managed Configuration disables automatic type detection and and forces handling according to the specified type. </p>

<p>Used to specify the name of a single extra named string value to be attached to the intent to be sent.</p>

<p>Android allows a collection of extra named values, of various types, to be attached to an intent. This Managed Configuration enables exactly one value whose data type must be string to be specified. When a name is specified, the additional Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type Send Intent Extra Value</strong> MUST also be specified to provide the corresponding value to be attached for the string extra identified by the specified name. </p>

<p>Used to specify the "friendly name" of an application to be launched when the value <strong><em>Launch Application</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type</strong>.</p>

<p>Note that the application "friendly name" is NOT the same as Android Package Name. The application "friendly name" is generally the name by which the application is identified in in-device UI, such as the application Title Bar and the list of application names display in the Recent Application list and the AppInfo section of the Settings Menu. To launch an application based on its Android Package Name, choose the value <strong><em>Send Intent</em></strong> is chosen for the Managed Configuration <strong>Key Mapping Configuration - Action Add Mapping Behavior Type</strong> instead.</p>

<h2 id="whitelistconfiguration" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#whitelistconfiguration"><span></span></a>Whitelist Configuration</h2>

<p>This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure which applications can be installed and run on a Zebra Android device. </p>

<h3 id="mode-1" class="anchor"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#mode-1"><span></span></a>Mode</h3>

<p>Used to configure the Whitelisting Mode, which determines how the applications that can be installed and run on a Zebra Android device is controlled.</p>

<p>-<strong><em>Package Name Only</em></strong>- allows only the app package name to control which applications can be installed and run.</p>

<p>-<strong><em>Package Name and Signature</em></strong>- requires the app package name <em>and</em> the signature to control which applications can be installed and run. </p>

<p>Using the value <strong><em>Package Name and Signature</em></strong> provides significantly better security than using <strong><em>Package Name Only</em></strong> since it provides much stronger protection against spoofing. If <strong><em>Package Name Only</em></strong> is used, any .apk file with a Android Package Name matching one of the allowed Package Names is allowed to be installed and run. Since any .apk file can be assigned any Package Name, the potential for a rogue application circumventing the protections of Whitelisting is relatively high. If <strong><em>Package Name and Signature</em></strong> is used, the Signature of an application must match an allowed Signature in addition to the Package Name matching and allowed Package Name. Since a rogue .apk file cannot be signed with a given Signature without possessing the corresponding Private Key, the chances of successfully spoofing are greatly reduced, and effectively eliminated if Private Keys are properly controlled.</p>
